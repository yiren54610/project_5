 Lelouch is the main protagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia. 
  
 Lelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders. 
  
 He is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and ""overprivileged parasites."" 
  
 Many characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world. 
  
 Despite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.","17 (first season), 18 (second season)","December 5, 1999 a.t.b.

 Rintaro Okabe (岡部 倫太郎 Okabe Rintarō?), often nicknamed Okarin (オカリン) or Hououin Kyouma (鳳凰院凶真), is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the main protagonist of the Steins;Gate series. 
  
 Okabe is a theatrical and eccentric individual. He is a self-proclaimed mad scientist, who likes to assume his ""true name"" ""Kyouma Hououin"" (鳳凰院凶真, Hououin Kyouma), and often uses this to introduce himself to others. Usually, people do not care and instead address him by his actual name or by 'Okarin' (his nickname), much to his chagrin. 
  
 Okabe is also socially inept; his social skills were so poor that Kurisu considers the childlike Mayuri to be usual by comparison. However, he isn't hesitant to lend a helping hand to people whom he'd never met. Although very intelligent, Okabe is easily deceived by others. 
  
 Okabe likes to pose as an agent working against a specific ""Organization,"" which he suggests is always after him, as he believes this kind of image gives him an excellent and mysterious aura. However, this seems to disappear as the story progresses, with SERN likely replacing the ""Organization's"" villainous image. He usually gives off the impression of being delusional and paranoid, displaying eccentric mannerisms such as talking to himself on the phone and engaging in fits of maniacal laughter.","18 (Steins;Gate), 19 (Steins;Gate 0)","December 14, 1991 (Sagittarius)",,"177 cm (5'10"")",University Student,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/122643.jpg

 Birthday: 1899 
 Birthplace: Resembool, Amestris 
 Family: Alphonse Elric (brother), Trisha Elric (mother, deceased), Van Hohenheim (father) 
 Affiliations: State Military, Winry Rockbell, Pinako Rockbell, Izumi Curtis (teacher), Roy Mustang (Commander) 
 Species: Human 
 Occupation: State Alchemist 
 Abilities: Alchemy, Martial Arts 
 Weapon: Alchemy, Automail arm and leg 
  
 Edward ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" Elric is a young alchemical prodigy. He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a ""hero of the people"" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering. 
  
 Edward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11""), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter. 
  
 Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy. 
  
 Edward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. 
  
 Though instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the ""One is All, All is One"" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation. 
  
 Devising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound. 
  
 Alphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life. 
  
 On the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years.

 Born in Konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, Naruto Uzumaki was destined for greatness. When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life. 
  
 Despite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki ) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto. 
  
 Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Boisterous, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to ""Team Seven"" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent. 
  
 Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of. 
  
 In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.","12-13 (Naruto part I), 15-17 (part II), 19 (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 27 (Naruto epilogue), 32 (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)",,,"145–147 cm (I), 166 cm (II), 174 cm (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 180 cm (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/61330.jpg

 Gintoki is a samurai living in an era when samurai are no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the ""White Devil"" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto. 
  
 Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances. 
  
 Gintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a ""Bankai"" similar to the characters of Bleach. 
  
 Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa. 
  
 Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.

During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place. 
  
 Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre. 
  
 He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.",17-18 (I); 21 (II),,,175 cm (I); 178 cm (II),,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/14/Itachi_Uchiha: 'src'

 Spike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, ""Waltz For Venus"". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an ""accident""). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly ""died"". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves ""too slow"". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye ""only sees the present"" and his left eye ""only sees the past."" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or ""No Smoking"" signs.

 Affiliation: Minegahara High School, 3rd year 
  
 Mai Sakurajima (桜島 麻衣, Sakurajima Mai) is the main character of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series. She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa. 
  
 Mai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat snappy or violent especially to Sakuta. Mai tends to ignore and stuff down unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that she is ""dishonest"", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness, she's pure-hearted and even shy around Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point. 
  
 Mai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take its toll on her. After being tricked and forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her early school years, Mai realized she was simply being used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, deciding to attend highschool. 
  
 However, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the ""odd one out"" and causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well.",17-18,,,"5'4"" (165 cm)","Student, Actress, Model",Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/118739/Mai_Sakurajima: 'src'

 Height: 5'8"" (173 cm) 
  
 Roy Mustang is the ""Flame Alchemist,"" having absolute control over heat and fire through alchemy. Using special gloves that create a spark when he snaps his fingers, Roy can create anything from a tiny ember to burn a letter, to a raging inferno that can destroy a humanoid body in seconds. His precise control over the alchemically enhanced flame is so accurate that he can boil the water in a persons' eyes and can also attack enemies amongst a riot without hurting any allies. 
  
 Outwardly arrogant and playfully manipulative, Mustang is intelligent and almost always one step ahead of his opponents, and likes to feel in control of the situation. He is one of the superiors of Edward Elric. On the surface, he appears to be nothing more than a man of the military who pursues promotions and praise and is considered a ladies' man who constantly goes on dates with different women. Mustang's true goal is to become Führer in order to gain the power to reform the government in order to absolve his sins in the Ishval War as well as change the country for the better, along with the joking requirement for female officers to wear tiny miniskirts (which considerably increased Havoc's loyalty to him and caused Hawkeye to be angry with him). 
  
 His goals are admirable enough that he earns the fierce loyalty of his good friends Lt Col. Maes Hughes, Major Alex Louis Armstrong, and his own subordinates, among whom are Riza Hawkeye, Jean Havoc, Heymans Breda, Vato Falman, and Kain Fuery. While Mustang has a close and amicable relationship with all of his subordinates, he appears to share a deeper bond of affection with his second-in-command Riza Hawkeye, who has devoted her life to supporting him. This bond culminates in the final episodes of the anime when Mustang chooses Hawkeye alone to accompany him on his greatest and most dangerous mission. 
  
 Though a hero of the Ishval War, he remains haunted by the horrors of war and suffers great remorse for the lives he took.",,,,"5'8"" (173 cm)",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/510227.jpg

 A 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily. 
  
 Through the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead. 
  
 Unfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide. 
  
 Onizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own. 
  
 It is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach). 
  
 Onizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage. 
  
 In spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing ""where's the nipple"" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town). 
  
 His personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO.

 Famous Quote: ""Having someone saying you're okay as you are being needed by that person. It was nice to have someone like that."" 
  
 Taiga is a girl in Ryuuji's class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname ""Palmtop Tiger."" 
  
 Her under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yuusaku Kitamura (which she later regrets). 
  
 Despite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father and mother got a divorce, leaving Taiga with her father. When he remarried another woman who was significantly younger than himself, it caused misunderstandings between Taiga and her step-mother. One day it became too much for Taiga, causing her to run away from home and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family. 
  
 At the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with Ryuuji's best friend Yuusaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend.

 Originally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo). 
  
 Dragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu & Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins & Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) & consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek). 
  
 In Dragon Ball GT , which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr. 
  
 In Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z , in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT ), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA. 
  
 In Cross Epoch , the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation. 
  
 In Dragon Ball Minus , it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine & Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away. 
  
 Gokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence. 
  
 He's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent). 
  
 Goku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai . In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten & Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).

 Famous quote: ""I'm crazy!? What's crazy is this world, that refuses to let me be with you."" 
  
 Yuno Gasai is obsessively in love with Yukiteru (Yandere) as one can safely guess from just the simple name of her future diary. Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her ""Yukiteru"" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's ""Random Diary"" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo. 
  
 Smart, beautiful and diligent—those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.",14-15,,,"159 cm (5'2"")","Future Diary Owner, Junior High School Student",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/280576.jpg

 Height: 160 cm 
 Weight: 43 kg 
  
 Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared. 
  
 She refers to herself as the ""Wise Wolf of Yoitsu"" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it. 
  
 Note: Concerning the spelling of Holo's name, Yen Press has stated that they ""were instructed that the proper spelling of the character's name is indeed Holo"" by the Japanese licensor.

 C.C. (pronounced ""C2"") is the tritagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. She is an immortal woman and the former leader of the Geass Order that abandons the order and allies herself with Lelouch vi Britannia, granting him his Geass power and becoming his right-hand. 
  
 C.C. is serious, solemn, and emotionally cut off from the world. For being betrayed in the past, she feels she cannot form a meaningful connection to anyone and only allies herself with others out of the pragmatic desire to reach her goal of ending her own life. Despite this, her time with Lelouch allows her to begin breaking down her emotional barriers, eventually learning to care for others again and see the value in her life, even making her experience what love feels like, an emotion she is unfamiliar with up to that point.

He has been called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and even the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot in the head at a young age but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. Because of this, he is very grateful to Dr. Tenma. He has spent portions of his life in different places under different aliases and possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He uses his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction. His original goal, as he stated when he was young, is to be the last one standing at the end of the world, although towards the end he decides upon a different fate. One of the themes of Monster is how individuals are capable of transforming into monsters; Johan often acts as both a direct and indirect catalyst for this transformation. Johan also shows strong attachment to his twin sister, Nina Fortner/Anna Liebert and refuses to leave her behind. 
  
  Note: ""Liebheart"" is Johan's official last name according to the Japanese anime page, but ""Liebert"" is his official name according to the English translation of the manga. Please leave his name as-is.

He has a recognizable attire of trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar. 
  
 He also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. While they are first shown as being completely separate, later publications cause more uncertainty as to where his hat and his hair actually meet. His hat is most likely a Japanese student cap that was normally worn along with the gakuran prior to the 1970s. 
  
 He is also known for a quick and short temper. He is the only JoJo to make an appearance in five different series. 
  
 Joutarou is Holy Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot himself in the head—a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, however, only Holy sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear of the guards and other prisoners towards him. 
  
 Joseph comes to Joutarou's aid with Muhammad Avdol. A brief fight ensues due to Joutarou's defiance, getting Avdol involved. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum, a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with ""the precision of a machine"" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a ""Fist of the North Star""-like sledgehammer barrage of fists. 
  
 In the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits Stand powers. But she also inherits the tradition of adventures that Joutarou tends to get entangled in. She also adopts an outfit style similar to his at one point due to her fascination and respect for her father. 
  
 He has a very tough exterior (despite the profile image indicating nothing of the sort), and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and/or respect—rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he's constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat. 
  
 In part 6, he also shows his protective father side, often taking near fatal blows for Jolyne and throttling her out of harm's way. After he is ""revived,"" Anasui, one of Jolyne's companions who is enthralled by her, asked Joutarou to approve of marrying her. Although he first acted deaf, Joutarou got the picture when he saw her lean against Anasui's chest. Not ready to see his daughter married off right away, he pulled his daughter into his arms, leaving Jolyne clueless to their interactions. His father, a jazz musician, is thought to receive his namesake from Sadao Watanabe, a jazz saxophonist. His father is always on tour and is never seen. 
  
 Joutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is how he spared Noriaki Kakyouin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that Kakyouin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave N'Dour a decent burial in the desert. 
  
 Joutarou's appearance is interesting in that he exhibits an anime archetype exhibited commonly by ""genius"" characters by forever staying young through all of his appearances in spite of age. 
  
 His catchphrase is ""Yare yare daze."" It has no direct translation but it is usually translated to the effect of, ""Gimme a break."" It can also mean ""Well well well..."" or ""all-right all-right...,"" since ""yare yare"" commonly translates to ""Oh well..."" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In the official Shonen Jump Advanced manga this is written as ""Give me a !@$&*# break.."" 
  
 In the manga, Joutarou is seen reading a Shounen Jump in his cell, with Shounen Jump being the magazine in which JoJo is published in Japan. These magazines also saved Joutarou from being fatally impaled by Dio's knives. 
  
 He is regarded by many as the most charismatic character of the JoJo series. 
  
 One of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. As an added bonus, it has a ""Star Finger"" attack in which it extends its finger to attack. It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him. 
  
 The Star card symbolizes, above all, hope. This is very appropriate, since Joutarou is very much the young new hope of the series. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou.

 Vice president of the student council of Shuchiin Academy, member of the Shinomiya Zaibatsu, and the daughter of the Shinomiya group, Kaguya Shinomiya is a multi-talented genius who can do anything if she sets her mind to it. Due to the way she was raised in the Shinomiya Family, she instinctively looks down on other people and thinks of ways to use them for her own benefit. Kaguya rarely interacted with other people before she joined the student council, but that has begun to change. She is an incredibly sheltered girl, resulting in her lacking in several pieces of what might be considered common sense. She still does not understand love very well, and her main objective is to make Miyuki Shirogane fall in love with and confess to her.

 Kaori Miyazono is one of the main protagonists of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. She is a violinist who helps Kousei Arima return to the piano world after his mother's death. 
  
 Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects on her personality. She is independent, unpredictable, and short-tempered. It is also touched upon that she is passive aggressive at times. Kaori likes to depend on herself and only herself and can be seen as more of a support for others. 
  
 While considered a really sloppy violin player from a technical standpoint, such as not following music score sheets the way they are written, Kaori is an amazing violinist. Noted by one of the judges at Towa Hall during the first competition of the series, her pure abilities far exceed the others in the competition. She wields a free spirited style of performance that emphasizes emotions and artistry over the pure mechanics of music, such playing to specific tempos and dynamics originally intended by the composer.

 Famous quote: "" The world is just another word for the things you value around you, right? That's something I've had since I was born. If you tell me to rule such a world, I already rule it. "" 
  
 Rin is a model student and idol of Shirou's school. She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests. 
  
 Two centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization. 
  
 Rin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker. 
  
 The rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty. 
  
 Although Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.",,,,"159 cm ( Fate/stay night ), 124 cm ( Fate/Zero )",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/270529.jpg

 Tanjirou Kamado is the main protagonist of Kimetsu no Yaiba , who becomes a Demon Hunter and joins the Demon Killing Corps to hunt down the demon who murdered his family and turned his sister Nezuko into a demon. 
  
 Tanjirou is kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes. He has a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve, an example being finding a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, he isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister. His biggest attribute is his ability to empathize with anyone, even demons.",13 (at the start of the manga); 15 (after completing training with Sabito and Makomo),,,"165cm (5'4"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/386735.jpg
67,Frieren(フリーレン),Sousou no FrierenYuushaSousou no Frieren: ●● no Mahou,24234,https://myanimelist.net/character/184947/Frieren,"Frieren was a mage in Hero Himmel's party. They travelled along with Priest Heiter and Warrior Eisen in a ten-year journey to defeat the Demon King. She was the last member to be recruited to the party and, despite Heiter's initial impression of her mana being average, Himmel had a hunch she was the most powerful mage he had ever met. 
  
 Being an elf that has lived for over a thousand years, Frieren has a hard time forming meaningful relationships with humans because of the difference in their lifespans and how they perceive the passage of time. This generally manifests itself as laziness, since missing an important event is of no importance as she will have plenty of opportunities to relive it in the future, or as a nearly sociopathic inability to comprehend human's feelings. For instance, she tends to not notice how her lack of impatience or cold statements can affect humans around her. Her party members have also frequently stated that they can't comprehend her feelings or read what goes on in her head. 
  
 Despite being an extremely powerful mage, Frieren has the habit of collecting rare and daily usage centered magic, like magic that can polish a bronze statue or make flowers bloom. She always asks for a grimoire as a reward even if she already knows its contents or when it comes to The Great Mage Flamme's lost grimoires knows they are fakes. 
  
 After the deaths of Hero Himmel and Priest Heiter, Frieren decided she wants to learn more about humans. She is currently traveling with Fern her pupil who was a war refugee left in her care by Priest Heiter in a quest to Ende, the place where souls reside in the northernmost tip of the continent and where the Demon King's Castle was built to try and speak to Himmel's soul. In her new journey, Frieren visits many places her old party travelled through in the past and relives memories, slowly understanding more about their meaning and her feelings. 
  
 Ironically, Fern is generally the one to take care of Frieren in daily activities despite being far younger.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/525105.jpg

 The main female protagonist. She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back. 
  
 Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.

 Yukino is the leader of the Service Club, of which she is the sole member until Hachiman joins her. She is smart, beautiful, and is nicknamed the ""Ice-cold Beauty"" for her icy demeanor. She has a twisted sense of ""noblesse oblige,"" and believes that it is the duty of the exceptional (in other words, herself) to help the ""lost lambs"" of the world.

 Senkuu is a straight-forward, confident, and highly logical individual who can come off as arrogant. Even so, his borderline-overconfidence does not cloud his judgment, as he is often backed up by his superior and vast knowledge of science. Senkuu never belittles those who are less knowledgeable than him. Rather, he encourages and inspires everyone around him to do better. Because of his charisma and caring nature, people tend to gather around him, both allies and supporters alike. However, he can act over-the-top at times when he is excited over a creation or at the discovery of something new.

 Relatives: Oreki Tomoe (sister) 
 Personality: Quiet, laid-back, lazy 
 Motto: ""If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, I'll make it quick."" 
  
 Oreki is a high-schooler with messy brown hair and green eyes. Due to his very lazy lifestyle, he almost always has a tired or bored look on his face. His hair is especially very messy when he wakes up. 
  
 He is shown to be a quiet student, and never concerned about things that happen around him. Despite being shown as an average high school student, he is quite intelligent and perceptive. The reason for his usual laziness is because he wishes to ""save energy."" Even though he is shown to be quite lazy, he never leaves his homework undone, as pointed out by Satoshi. He's considered lazy and apathetic, always living on the ""gray"" side, and is not interested in any activities that might waste his time and energy. He actually never intended to join any club, but his sister ordered him to join the Classics Club to save it from being disbanded. Even though he might not seem it, he's unbelievably good at solving mysteries and seems to be able to always find a solution if he gives it a thought. He has a habit of holding his bangs whenever he's thinking about a mystery.

 Kurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her. Kurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the façade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers. In hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has. Mana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shidou seduced shows some ""independent"" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shidou, which causes troubles to the ""main"" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her.",,,,"157 cm (5'2"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/310255.jpg

 On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls ""Return by Death"" to go back in time when he dies, with only himself being aware of the reversal of time. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak. 
  
 While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the ""easy"" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

 Height: 185 cm (6'1"") 
 Affiliation: Faustian Contract 
 Occupation: Butler of the Phantomhive Household 
 Previous occupations: Second-String Member of the Noah's Ark Circus and Dormitory Warden of Sapphire Owl at Weston College 
  
 Sebastian Michaelis is the demon butler of the Phantomhive household. He often describes himself through the phrase ""Because I am simply one hell of a butler"" (わたしはあくまで執事ですから, Watashi wa akumade shitsuji desu kara). The phrase plays on the word ""demon"" (あくま, akuma) and the phrase ""to the end"" (あくまで, akumade). It can also translate to ""I am a demon and a butler."" 
  
 Sebastian is highly skilled in any area and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural as the butler to the Phantomhive family. This is due to the fact he is a demon bound by a Faustian contract to abide by Ciel's will. A sign similar to the one marking Ciel's right eye can be found on Sebastian's left hand, which has been used on one occasion to twist the arm of a kidnapper without touching him.

 Birth date: 732 Age 
 Height: 5' 5"" 
 Weight: 123 lbs (56 kg) 
 Hobby: Training 
 Favorite food: All types of food

 Known family: King Vegeta (father), Tarble (brother), Bulma (wife), Trunks (son), Bra [Bulla] (daughter) 
  
 Vegeta is a fictional character from the manga series Dragon Ball, created by Akira Toriyama. 
  
 Along with Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series, originally starting out as a villain before becoming a mainstay hero. 
  
 Vegeta starts out haughty, arrogant, self-entitled and ruthless as the prince of Saiyans. His royal status caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most, if not all people he encounters. Regal, egotistical and full of pride, Vegeta was once a ruthless, cold-blooded warrior and outright killer. However, as the story unfolds, he changes to a person capable of caring about and loving someone other than himself. 
  
 Vegeta was once a young member of the Saiyan army, but after his race's demise, he worked alongside Nappa and Raditz, directly under Freeza. He seeks immortality to rule the universe, but once he learns about Freeza destroying his planet from Dodoria, he resolves to take out Freeza (not to avenge his race, but to assure his own rule over the universe as well as to get back at Freeza for unknowingly using him to further his own goals). He later battles Freeza with the main cast on Namek and dies in the ensuing fights; once he is revived, he returns to Earth, where he adjusts to everyday life and remains there for good. 
  
 In Cross Epoch (the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for ""vegetable."" Trunks, Usopp and Nico Robin are members of his crew.

 Hange is very passionate and driven in pursuit of new knowledge. They can be seen as very hyperactive, often diving into projects without thought for personal safety (and frightening lots of subordinates in the process), instead preoccupied with observing and documenting the subjects. Some misunderstand these acts and Hange is seen as eccentric and having more than a few screws loose. They also enjoy discussing this research, but as the lectures can be very long and detail-oriented, not many fellow soldiers find them interesting. 
  
 Hange is often excited by Titans and is always eager to experiment with them, coming off as extremely emotional regarding titans.

 Ability Parameters (out of 5): power = 1; jump = 5; stamina = 5; intellect = 1; technique = 1; speed = 5 
  
 Hinata has an unusually high ability to jump. Since he was young, Hinata trained his legs to compensate for his lack of height. He joins Karusuno High School Volleyball team and amazes the team with his natural affinity as a spiker. Although he is a complete beginner and never had any experience playing in a volleyball team, he grows rapidly through each match. 
  
 Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He's a natural schmoozer and his teammates would sometimes use him to win someone over, such as Nishinoya. Hinata gets excited easily and often talks loudly. He is the loudest member after Nishinoya and Tanaka. He is friendly and can befriend anyone easily, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High. 
  
 Despite his easy-going personality, Hinata is extremely competitive, especially when it comes to volleyball. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata has a very big fortitude to win and thus, doesn't give up easily during a match no matter if it's a practice match or a real match. Hinata can also exhibit a very scary and intimidating face when people underestimate him. Despite that, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents.

 Hair: Scarlet 
 Eyes: Brown 
 Magic and Abilities: Requip (also known as Ex-quip is a Caster Magic and a type of Spatial Magic related to the summoning of various types of equipment.) 
  
 Erza Scarlet is a S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild, the strongest still active female, and one of the main female protagonists in Team Natsu. 
  
 Erza, is a tall, beautiful young woman with long red hair, and brown eyes. She is almost always wearing an armored suit, made by Heart Kreuz. However, thanks to her requip magic, she can wear many magic armors, and can even requip swim suits, and clothes for recreational purposes. Her member stamp is on her left shoulder. She wears a standard medieval armor, but has a number of other themed armors such as Flame (or Lightning) Empress, which absorb the respected magic type, Adamantium,  Samurai-style and more. 
  
 Erza is a very strict person, often criticizing the bad behavior and habits of the other guild members, causing most them to apologize for fear that they might invoke her wrath. She is also impatient, liking people who answer her questions quickly as seen when she promptly knocks out anyone who doesn't answer her questions (despite them not knowing anything). Also, Erza has a problem where she apparently sees everyone as guild members (best seen when she asks civilians to take things places during a mission). However, she has a great sense of justice. Despite being a very strict person, she seems to have a clumsy side to her as seen during the Galuna arc when she fell into a pit hole. 
  
 Like most Fairy Tail members, she shows great loyalty and dedication to Makarov and the guild. She pushed herself past her limit in the war against the Phantom Lord Guild, fighting against its many powerful members. She also became the temporary leader when Makarov had to be treated because of his scattered magic. 
  
 Although it hasn't been fully explored, it is implied that Natsu Dragneel, Erza and Gray Fullbuster are all very close to each other. While staying over at Lucy's house, Erza revealed that the three of them used to take showers together. It is later revealed that Erza, Natsu, and Gray have all been part of Fairy Tail ever since they were children.",19,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/5189/Erza_Scarlet: 'src'

 Sung Jin-Woo is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling . Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. 
  
 Jin-Woo is a confident individual with a strong sense of family and a thirst for power. As a result, he is very close to his mom and sister and rarely wastes an opportunity to grow stronger. 
  
 Despite being strong and respected, Jin-Woo isn't arrogant and is both polite and easygoing in person. He is also mostly indifferent to materialistic desires such as fame and fortune and can be very selfless. In battle, however, he is ruthless, slaughtering his enemies indiscriminately and even somewhat disdainful.",24,,,,"Hunter, Guild Master",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/540692.jpg

Musashi is the son of a samurai family, whose father was one of the most renowned samurai across the nation. One of the foremost reasons that drives Musashi to excel in sword-fighting is his desire to overcome his father due to the harsh treatment Musashi received during his childhood because of his incapability of rebelling. 
  
 Musashi is unique in terms of his sword skill due to the unfamiliar movements and lack of style he uses. This is due to the fact that he spent most of his time in the forest labeled as a demon child by his village because of his demeaning and wicked nature.

 Favorite word: Ayuzawa Misaki 
  
 One of the most popular boys at Seika High, Usui appears to take little interest in anything and prefers to observe things as they unfold, though proves to be extraordinarily talented in numerous areas. He develops an interest in Misaki and is the first to learn she is working at a maid café, but chooses to keep her secret and soon falls in love with her. While she dismisses his behavior simply as harassment and teasing (but claims he just wanted to see her ""interesting expressions""), he continues to watch over and protect her no matter what it takes like injuring himself in the process, as well as offering insightful advice on how to deal with the boys at Seika effectively and fairly. He appears to be the only male student at school that Misaki is willing to speak to as an equal.

 Birthday: September 22 
 Horoscope: Virgo 
 Blood Type: AB 
 Height: 170 cm 
 Weight: 53.4 kg 
 Rank: Genin (I); Chuunin (II) 
 Likes: taking naps, playing shogi 
 Dislikes: Hard-boiled eggs 
  
 Shikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such, lives his life avoiding work. This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark ""how troublesome."" 
  
 Despite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma's death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday. 
  
 One of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and ""a pain."" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case. 
  
 When the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin. 
  
 Once becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma's brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy.",12 (I); 15 (II),,,170 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/131315.jpg

 Gyro has a cocky and flamboyant personality, appearing to have a high opinion of himself. However, he can be driven by emotions for other people and become realistic and serious when a problem presents itself. Like most Manga archetypes, Gyro is incredibly intelligent when he needs to be. His most distinguishable body features are his long hair, western hat and his metal teeth which have ""GO! GO! ZEPPELI"" displayed on them, revealed whenever he smiles at someone. His signature laugh/chuckle is ""Nyo ho ho ho~."" 
  
 Note that the ""Caesar"" in his name is pronounced in the traditional Greek way, more akin to the German ""Kaiser."" This is distinct from Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 2, whose name is pronounced in the modern English way.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/311885.jpg

 She and Ryoji Kaji were lovers during college, and slowly rekindle their romance over the course of the series. She was also friends with Ritsuko Akagi in college and their relationship unravels as Misato learns more about NERV and SEELE.

 Birthday: December 25 
 Height: 175 cm 
 Blood type: AB 
 Abilities: assassination, academics 
 Favorite subject: mathematics 
 Least favorite subject: Japanese 
 Favorite food: his own cooking 
 Hobby: provocation, mischief and harassment 
 Class seat number: 1 
  
 Karma is well-known throughout the school for his violent behavior and troublesome attitude. When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei. 
  
 Karma has been described by Karasuma as ""at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes."" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E. 
  
 It is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting. 
  
 Regardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain ""vision"" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent. 
  
 Despite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'. 
  
 He's also shown to be hardworking when he wants to by studying diligently after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games.

 Parents: Miyamura, Naozumi (father) and Miyamura, Iori (mother) 
  
 In school, he gives off an impression of a quiet, anti-social guy. Usually assumed to be an otaku with good studying capabilities, Miyamura is soon to be viewed as a good friend to both Kyouko and her closest friends. Despite the weather, Miyamura tries to cover up as much as possible in order to hide his tattoos and leaves his long hair loose to cover up his piercings. This image briefly changes once he leaves school, particularly at Kyouko's house. Once he is outside of school, he removes his blazer and necktie and wears his hair up which visibly shows his multiple ear piercings. He also enjoys getting lattes from Starbucks and does not mind wearing short sleeves that show off part of his tattoos. Unlike most characters that wear glasses, Miyamura does very poorly in his studies, only managing to score full marks in P.E and average (or below) in all other classes. Although usually having trouble pronouncing certain Japanese words, he is very good at tongue twisters.

 Height: 158 cm (5'2"") 
 Blood type: AB 
 Occupation: Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder 
  
 Background 
 Haruhi Suzumiya, a first year student at North High School (in novels 1-8), and second year (in the 9th and latest novel), can be characterized as funny, eccentric, and somewhat unpredictable. In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for ""ordinary"" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits. 
  
 Kyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person. 
  
 She is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.",15-17,,,"158 cm (5'2"")","Student (grade 10-11), Ultra Director, Ultra Detective, Brigade Chief and Founder",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/284136.jpg

 Famous quote: "" 'All the evils in the world'? Bring thrice as much if you want to stain me! "" 
  
 An arrogant, selfish, and enigmatic Archer-class Servant. He appears familiar with Fuyuki City and claims to have a past relationship with Saber. Typically clad in an ornate golden armor, he possesses an immense number of Noble Phantasms, though none are representative of his true identity. 
  
 Gilgamesh is the great half-god, half-human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two thirds god and one third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu. 
  
 His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms. Though there are several heroes holding the title of ""King,"" the King of Knights and King of Conquerors, he is the only one in all of heaven and earth crowned with the title of ""King of All Heroes.""",,,,"182 cm (6'0"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/338672.jpg

 Maomao became a maidservant to the Emperor's harem after being kidnapped and sold. She used to live with her father as a pharmacist in the red light district and is very knowledgeable about medicine and poisons but isn't very interested in other humans. 
  
 She is skinny and short, and her plain face is covered with freckles. 
  
 Abilities Herbal medicine: Having been taught by Ruomen, one of the best pharmacists in the country, Maomao is an excellent user and maker of herbs—so much so that she makes her own unique medicine, which she often tests on herself.Poison resistance: Because she constantly experiments with poisons on her own body, Maomao has developed a mithridatic resistance against drugs and poisons. Whether afflicted by snake bite, aphrodisiac, alcohol, or hallucinogenic mushroom, her body is able to resist the effects, and she is able to consume the same alcohol content as multiple grown men combined.Perception: Having been raised in the red light district, Maomao is very good at dealing with and manipulating others. Along with her experience and knowledge of herbs, she is able to deduce and solve problems more effectively than most. In spite of this, she does not consider herself intelligent by academic standards, as the only thing she can bring herself to study is medicine. Maomao's name is derived from 猫 (māo), the Chinese word for cat. This reinforces the fact that she is often described as a cat or cat-like.",17,,,"153 cm (5'0"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/371204.jpg

 Kyou is a stubborn, hot-headed boy. He is easily provoked and angered in any situation. As with most of the Sohma clan, Kyou is cursed with becoming an animal of the Zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite gender. His Zodiac animal is the cat which, in legend, was barred from becoming one of the official twelve animals because of the rat's trickery. Kyou hates the current rat of the family, Yuki, as a result. The two constantly fight and Kyou loses every time. 
  
 Ever since he met Honda Tooru, who admires the cat of Zodiac legend, he has expressed a soft side of himself. Kyou was always separated from the Sohma clan, including his parents, which is likely the cause of his short-fused temperament and stubbornness. He constantly trains in martial arts so that he might one day defeat his rival, Yuki. His martial arts master is one of the people he respects the most.

 Birthday: May 28 
 Height: 142 cm (4'8"") 
 Handedness: Ambidextrous 
 Zodiac Sign: Gemini 
 Residence: Satte, Saitama Prefecture 
 Blood type: A 
 Strong Subjects: PE (However, it is not her favorite subject)

 Konata Izumi is, more by default than anything else, the ""leader"" of the main characters. Nicknamed ""Kona-chan"" by her friends, she is an eccentric but friendly and outgoing girl, with a mischeivous but good-natured sense of humor. She can be smart, but she hates studying, thus her grades are a bit uneasy. However, she is an expert in pulling an ""all-nighter."" In contrast to her studying habits, she loves video games, to the extent that she can compete against Kagami Hiiragi on trivia games (by remembering the question orders, not by knowing the actual answers). In addition, she loves anime, which is also due to her father, Soujirou Izumi's influence, along with the games. He buys ero-games for himself, so she is able to play and enjoy them. In fact, when she became eighteen, Konata was overjoyed, since she could now go buy and play ero-games legally. In the anime, Konata constantly refers to or parodies several popular games, anime, and manga (much to the annoyance of Kagami), but her favorite franchise seems to be the Haruhi series, as she has many Haruhi figurines and decorations that makes her room, and even once went to the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou with her friends. She often gives false information to her family, thus making her father believe that Kagami and Tsukasa are shrine maidens. Interestingly enough, her voice actress for the animated version, Aya Hirano and Wendee Lee, is in fact the same person who voiced Haruhi Suzumiya in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime; other voice actors from the same series make guest appearances during the course of Lucky ☆ Star. 
  
 Since she spends quite a large sum of money on video games and doujinshi, Konata was lucky enough to get a part-time job at a cosplay cafe. Continuing with her theme of playing video games, Konata plays the role of a male character in an online game and is married in that world. Her significant other in the game is coincidently a male gamer using a female character. She often plays late into the night, hence why she tends to fall asleep in class, which makes her a frequent victim to her homeroom teacher, Nanako Kuroi. One of her talents as mentioned on the show is that she can name all the Pok$#!ns 
  
 Her physique is smaller than average when compared to her peers, which she claims hasn't changed, since she was in the sixth grade. She is ambidextrous, in contrast to the mostly left-handed main cast. She has long, blue hair which comes down to her calves with a large ahoge, sleepy eyes and a beauty mark under her left eye, just like her father. Her mother, Kanata Izumi, died when she was an infant, and she has lived alone with her father since. In her third year of high school, however, her cousin, Yutaka Kobayakawa, came to live at her house, giving a total of three people in the Izumi residence.

 Age: 18 
 Birthday: June 3 
 Hair: maroon (anime), black (light novel) 
 Eyes: red 
  
 Abandoned by his parents, Sora is a brilliant NEET hikikomori gamer along with his stepsister, Shiro. He does not take life very seriously and is pretty much a good-for-nothing gamer. One day, he and his sister are called into an alternate world. 
  
 Sora is tall and thin with spiky brown hair, and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. Despite being a NEET and a shut in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face-to-face, even when they are cheating. He is also extremely manipulative, which he refers to as using negotiating skills. This fits in with his play style. While Shiro is excellent at logic and computing, Sora can read people and predict what their next move is, using this knowledge to beat them. 
  
 However, if he is separated from Shiro by so much as a closed door, he becomes a spineless, cowardly wreck, and only returns to his former self if he is able to see her. He views his sister as his equal and partner, but is also protective of her, shown by actions such as putting his body between her and the ground when he thought they were going to hit hard when first arriving on Disboard. 
  
 Sora is extroverted and has no problems dealing with people. While not as intelligent as Shiro, he is shown to have a brilliant IQ. Rather than computing numbers like Shiro, Sora can rapidly compute what his opponents are going to do based on observing their behavior and motivations. He is also slightly perverted and desires a girlfriend for himself. His lust leads to a linguistic mistake that causes Stephanie to fall in love with him and causes him to receive a scolding from Shiro.

 Nino Nakano is one of the main characters of the 5-toubun no Hanayome series. She is the second sister of the Nakano Quintuplets who usually acts as the mother of the family; cooking for them and taking care of their medical needs. Among the five sisters, she is the one who has the highest hostility towards Fuutarou Uesugi and often rebelled against him early in the series. 
  
 Nino has an outgoing personality and is socially aware, resulting in her having many friends and is a social butterfly. She has a sharp tongue and talks bluntly when confronting others, even to her sisters. Her rebellious attitude makes her the least cooperative girl among the sisters, making her archetype resemble that of a ""tsundere.""",17-18,,,165 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/437011.jpg

 Tomoya Okazaki is the male protagonist of Clannad. Due to his habit of always arriving late to school, skipping classes during the day, and staying out all night, he has been labeled as a delinquent, or a young person who defies authority. 
  
 He is a childhood friend of Kotomi Ichinose and is best friends with Youhei Sunohara. As he progresses through high school, he meets many new friends, such as Kyou, Ryou, Tomoyo, Fuko, and of course Nagisa. He has a knack for solving the problems of his friends, and seems to care for all of them deeply. He is also seemingly unaware that some of the girls at school show interest in him.

 Eye: Brown 
 Hair: Black 
 Weapons: Double-Edged Tsurugi (often mistaken for a Katana) and Tanto (concealed in hilt of scabbard) 
 Sword style: ""Champloo Kendo"" 
  
 Mugen is rude, vulgar, and often thinks highly of himself. Much of his past is a mystery. He was born on the Ryukyu Islands, never knew his parents, and was a former pirate. After an incident forced him to fake his death, he became a vagabond. But things changed after he met Jin and Fuu. Though very rough around the edges, he has a mutual understanding with Jin and cares for Fuu more than he lets out, considering he usually ends up going after her whenever she gets kidnapped. 
  
 His fighting style is described as a ""champloo,"" which means ""mix."" It combines all sorts of martial arts, unorthodox swordplay and break dancing. He relies on instinct and reflex to surprise his enemies. 
  
 His style of clothing represents the future, whereas Jin's represents the past. His black hair is usually untidy, and is similar in shape to an afro.

 Born: 19th November (Area 80 North) 
 Height: 202 cm 
 Weight: 108 kg 
 Hates: Natto 
 Hobbies: Fighting strong opponents 
 Theme Song: ""Superpredators"" by Massive Attack 
  
 Note: The only Captain who didn't take the exam to become a Shinigami. 
  
 Zaraki's surname comes from the district he once resided in, Zaraki, which is district #80 of the North Alley of Rukongai. District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies. 
  
 At some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru (八千流), in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi (草鹿), where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship. 
  
 Also, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn't actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death. 
  
 After some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain's seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.

 Shiro is an 11-year-old genius NEET, hikikomori gamer who is a part of 『　　』 (Blank or Kuuhaku) player, along with her step-brother, Sora. 
  
 Shiro is described as a genius in logic and problems, but has difficulty understanding emotions or behavior, relying on Sora to help her defeat human opponents such as Tet in their chess match. She also rarely shows much emotion at all on her face and, despite her genius intellect, speaks in short terse sentences. Shiro is extremely close to her brother, to the point of needing him by her side at all times to be comfortable. She is also shown to have a dry and somewhat twisted sense of humor, and displays signs of jealousy if Sora pays serious attention to other girls, showing she has a brother complex.

 Kisuke Urahara always wears traditional Japanese wooden sandals and a bucket hat, which has earned him the nickname ""sandal-hat"" (ゲタ帽子, geta-bōshi?, ""Mr. Hat-and-Clogs"" in the English version). He is generally a laid-back, jovial fellow, although he can be dead serious when the situation warrants it. Despite his carefree attitude, his speech is always polite, though it is sometimes sarcastic. Yoruichi Shihouin notes that he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about.

 Age: 15 
 Height: 181.9 cm 
 Weight: 66.3 kg 
 Birthday: December 22, 1996 
 Year: 1st Year, class 3 
 Number: 9 
 Position: Setter 
 Favorite Food: Pork curry with a soft-boiled egg on top 
 Current Concerns: He's worried that animals seem to dislike him 
 Ability Parameters (out of 5): power = 4; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 4 
  
 Kageyama was initially referred to as ""King of the Court,"" a derogatory nickname that insinuates his autocratic nature, given to him by his former teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi during his late middle school days. Kageyama is widely regarded as a stunning prodigy and an absolute genius by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and rediscover what it means to be part of a team. 
  
 Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is actually much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration and express his thoughts and emotions in an appropriate way. 
  
 Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen (Sugawara and Asahi in particular), as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. This has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter.",15,,,181.9 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/417874.jpg

 Weight: 50 kg 
 Blood Type: O 
 Sign: Sagittarius 
 Birthday: November 27 
 Age: 15-18 
  
 Favorite Music: Yui doesn't follow any particular style, and isn't picky. As long as she likes it, anything is OK. 
 Experience with musical instruments: Castanets 
 Family Structure: Family of four, both parents and younger sister (Ui). Father works for a trading company, gets a lot of overseas assignments and tends to be absent. Because the mother often travels overseas too (helping the father), the daughters have many opportunities to spend time alone together. 
 Dwelling: Single family detached home. 
 Commute to school: Walking. 
 Preferences in clothing: Pants over skirts. Yui is relatively fashion conscious and likes styles featured in teen magazines. She also wears casual clothes such as shorts and T-shirts at home. 
 Her room: Clean, because Ui cleans it. Yui likes small cute things, and keeps stuffed toys and such in her room. The room is painted in girly pastel and pink tones. 
 Favorite food: Anything, as long as it's sweet and delicious. 
 Subjects she is good at: Between low and average and can rarely pass test easily, but has a hard time with questionnaires. 
 Subjects she is bad at: All of them 
 Physical exercise: She can do it, but hates getting tired. 
 Way to pass time when alone: Lazing around at home. 
 Weaknesses and dislikes: Studying. 
  
 Main character, guitarist, lead vocalist. Having misunderstood that ""light music"" equals ""easy music"" (like whistling), she joined the Light Music Club and picked up guitar with absolutely no prior experience. She is the type of person who doesn't read manuals and relies on her own intuition and self-taught approaches. 
  
 Yui is the lead guitarist and split vocalist of the Light Music Club who plays a Heritage Cherry Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Standard electric guitar that she nicknames ""Gīta"" (ギー太). Before she learned how to play the electric guitar, the only instrument she knew how to play was the castanets. She gets poor grades in school (though when properly coached, she can achieve astounding results), spaces out frequently, and is easily distracted by trivialities (mainly those she deems cute). Yui is a kind and friendly girl who holds no ill-will towards anyone. Yui has shoulder-length, brown hair (a little longer than Ritsu's) which she accessorizes with two yellow hair clips, and brown eyes. She has a huge liking for sweets and consumes them frequently (though she never gains weight, which is greatly envied by Mugi, Mio, and Sawako). She has a younger sister named Ui, who is very mature and acts as the ""older sister"" of Yui, taking care of her while their parents are away on business trips. Despite her difficulties with distractions, Yui works extremely hard to get better at playing guitar. During performances, Yui plays with amazing energy and joy which usually results in great response from the audience. 
  
 As a musician, Yui has absolute pitch—she can tune her guitar perfectly without a tuner, which greatly impresses Azusa, who possesses far more experience with playing guitar than Yui. She has a very easy-going nature, but has incredible focus and retention when she has a clear goal in sight. Yui is still devoted to her band and will always practice hard enough for the club. At school, she has become quite admired for her great voice. However, she has been shown to forget her lyrics mid-performance on at least one occasion and exert herself too much, making her unable to perform sometimes. Mio was the lead vocalist at first, since Yui could not play the guitar and sing at the same time.

 Juuzou Suzuya is a Rank 3 Ghoul Investigator. In the past, he went by the name Rei Suzuya. He is the partner of Yukinori Shinohara. He is a young man with an androgynous appearance. He bears stitches on his lips and other places, used as both first-aid and fashion. His hair is pinned with a stitching string in a Roman numeral 13 pattern, and has large pupils that leave an eerie and frightening impression. 
  
 Juuzou has a childish, careless behaviour, does not care for the property of others, is enthusiastic, and often very resourceful in his job. He seems to have no qualms in killing ghouls. 
  
 After the two-year time skip of Tokyo Ghoul:re , Suzuya's hair is dyed black, and he is the leader of his own squad. He demonstrates maturity and even appears to empathize with ghouls unlike before. He is also far more invested in the welfare of his CCG coworkers, and has a particularly close relationship with Sasaki Haise.

 Kira (which sounds similar to Killer in Japanese), longs for a simple life, and doesn't wish to be bothered. Although he reveals many talents, this yearning shows in his dislike of coming in first, as the cast eventually realizes. He becomes quite bothered when someone disrupts his ""simplicity,"" and goes to extreme lengths to get it back. He keeps a collection of his own fingernail clippings, and believes when they grow quickly he has trouble.

 Birthday: January 15 
 Height: 160 cm 
 Weight: 54 kg 
 Blood type: A 
 Sign: Capricorn 
 Favorite Music: jazz, moody instrumental music 
  
 Experience with playing musical instruments: Started playing bass in middle school after Ritsu suggested it to her. 3 years of experience. 
 Family structure: Family of three, both parents. Typical household of an office worker. 
 Dwelling: Single family detached home. 
 Commute to school: Walking. 
 Preferences in clothing: Pants over skirts. In summertime she likes to wear sleeveless clothes, such as tank tops. 
 Her room: Clean and tidy. Chic room with simple door. Actually Mio wants to decorate her room with cute things, but she does not have any because she is self-conscious about them not suiting her and because she does not want to be teased when Ritsu comes over. 
 Favourite food: Gateau au Chocolat (rich layered chocolate cake). 
 Subjects she is good at: All subjects. She is always in the top 10 among all students of her grade. 
 Subjects she is bad at: No subject in particular. 
 Physical activity: Good at sports. 
 Way to pass the time when alone: Studying. 
 Weaknesses and dislikes: Scary stories. Stories about pain. 
  
 Mio is a shy girl who is in the light music club. She plays a left-handed, 3-Color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard, though is shown playing a Fender Precision Bass in the first manga volume. She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name Elizabeth later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu is involved; her weakness is the macabre and horrific, and she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also has a fear of being in the spotlight and gets embarrassed easily, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials. 
  
 Along with Yui, Mio is one of the band's main vocalists, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like ""Light and Fluffy Time."" As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments, because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play. Mio comes to greatly enjoy her time at university as she encounters many new experiences. She is also able to overcome some of her shyness and make new friends such as Sachi and Ayame.

 Manga Debut: Chapter #370 
 Anime Debut: Naruto Shippūden Episode #130 
  
 Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was a legendary ninja who led the Uchiha clan prior to and after the formation of Konohagakure. 
  
 Before the era of ninja villages, Madara and his younger brother, Izuna, were considered the most gifted members of the Uchiha clan. Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong. He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each gained their own Mangekyō Sharingan. With the power of the Mangekyō the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara as its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across. Because of the never-ending series of battles of the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangekyō Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an ""eternal"" Mangekyō Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity. 
  
 Over the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan. To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept. The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure. 
  
 Some time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage much to Madara's dismay. Madara feared that Hashirama would oppress the Uchiha, and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, the Uchiha turned their backs on him, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war. 
  
 Soon after being rejected the position of Hokage and being abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, and sought out Nine-Tails. He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was defeated, despite having Nine-Tails at his side. Control of Nine-Tails was ultimately taken from him and Madara died.",,,,,"Co-founder of Konohagakure, Leader of the Uchiha clan",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/450359.jpg

 The captain and setter of the Aoba Jousai High School Volleyball Club. Oikawa was also Kageyama's senpai when they were attending Kitagawa Daiichi. According to Kageyama, he is a very talented setter and volleyball player with a bad personality. 
  
 Oikawa also frequently makes cheerful remarks, but follows them up with serious or intimidating afterthoughts. Despite his flirtatious and blasé exterior, Oikawa is extremely intelligent and cunning, to the point of his own teammates stating they wouldn't want to be friends with him because he figures out everyone's weakness. 
  
 He holds a grudge against Kageyama, whom he mockingly calls Tobio-chan. This is due to his feelings of inferiority when compared to Kageyama, who has been hailed as a genius setter since their time spent at Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama can unintentionally bring out the more childish or rash aspects of Oikawa's personality.

 Kaiki has a gloomy personality and subscribes to the view that there is nothing in the world that is inherently true.

 Kaiki is an individual who prides himself in having no pride. He openly admits to being a conman and an impostor, among other things, but often this is to his advantage as a master of wordplay.

 Howl is described as being tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair and wearing impressive suits. However, he is described by Calcifer as ""very vain for a plain man with mud-colored hair.""

Hinata was trained by her father, Hiashi Hyuga, to become the clan's heiress, though in time he came to deem her a lost cause.

After graduating from College, Kento quit being a sorcerer and became a salaryman for a few years before returning as a sorcerer after realizing it was a better option between the two career choices. 
  
 Kento  dresses like a salaryman with a grey suit, a spotted tie, black shoes, and his signature arm-less sunglasses. 
  
 Kento is known to be serious and reserved both in and outside of work. Regardless, he is a kind man who values the lives of his companions. Seeing his work as a sorcerer is very appreciated by the people he helped, was what prompted him to return as a sorcerer to help more people in the future.",,"July 3, 1990",,184 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/581424.jpg

 Birthday: November 3 
 Zodiac: Scorpio 
 Height: 155 cm 
 Weight: 40 kg 
  
 Kagura, meaning ""god-entertainment"" is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama. 
  
 Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have ""transparent"" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise by her hands. 
  
 She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight. 
  
 Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods. 
  
 Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame. 
  
 She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon. 
  
 Kagura and Gintoki share an odd brother-younger sister-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them makes for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although she herself has gotten into many fights with him, she rarely lets anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come and save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits (like picking her nose or swearing, hence her unladylike behavior) and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with ""Gin-chan says..."" or ""Gin-chan told me..."" 
  
 Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself are common behavior for Kagura. 
  
 She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that ""he definitely likes me,"" but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain on if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her. 
  
 Although Kagura usually teases Shinpachi, she deeply cares for him and thinks of him as a brother. She also shows great respect toward his older sister, Shimura Tae, often calling her ""Anego"" (a term gangster women use to show respect). 
  
 Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu (being her 27th pet), have met with an untimely demise by her hands (with the exception of Sadaharu 28,' a beetle killed by Okita). She cuddles with Sadaharu when feeling down. Kagura also seems to be the only one (aside from Ane, Mone, and Komako) who Sadaharu listens to. 
  
 According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu. 
  
 In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh (aru), nope, and the like.","14, 16 (Silver Soul Aftermath), 19-20 (Be Forever Yorozuya)",,,155 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/505912.jpg

 Yuu is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often bodes ill for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence in order to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities. 
  
 Yuu can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Ryuunosuke Tanaka puts it, ""he simply gets too fired up for his own good."" He doesn't bother to filter his words, and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically: he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly.

 Dislikes: being bored, not having apples, relapse 
  
 The original Shinigami who dropped the Death Note in the human world, and also love apples, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.

 Second year in Kasensou Private Preparatory Academy. Childhood friend of Rintarou's, and slow by nature. Speaks in a very wavy manner, and seems to always be smiling and having fun. She's quite the optimist. She has trouble understanding complicated theories, but doesn't mind as long as it's enjoyable. Doesn't like people arguing, and is depressed when things are unpleasant. Though she'd like to ease the situation in such cases, she's not really good at reading between the lines. She often went with her grandmother to see the stars on her grandmother's back. Because of that, she has a habit of reaching her arm out to the sky at times, which has led Rintarou to naming it the ""Stardust Shakehand."" She abruptly does this (even if she's talking with someone), which surprises everyone around her.

194,Death the Kid(デス・ザ・キッド),Soul EaterSoul Eater NOT!,11585,https://myanimelist.net/character/8455/Death_the_Kid,"Classification: Immortal, Shinigami, Meister 
  
 He is Patricia ""Patti/Patty"" Thompson's and Elizabeth ""Liz"" Thompson's Meister and Death's son. He was born from a fragment of Shinigami's soul. 
  
 Being the son of Shinigami, Kid was singled out. The other students at Shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was Shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. This continued until he became the meister of Liz and Patti. They became good comrades, and even helped Kid. Kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. He is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at Shibusen. 
  
 Kid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or OCPD, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. Objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. Thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. He is so obsessed with symmetry that Kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. Even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. The fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. As a result of his OCPD, Kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself ""useless asymmetrical garbage."" Kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the Sanzu Lines continued to reappear. This is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. The Index of the Book of Eibon referred to this obsession as Madness of Order. 
  
 His favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. An example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met Soul on his first day of DWMA. When Soul said that if Kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. Instead of focusing on the entire comment.. Kid replied, ""No, it can't be seven! Say eight, dammit! Eight is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be eight instead! Eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back, I beg of you! Please say eight! Please!"" only to become further distressed when Black Star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school. 
  
 Despite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, Kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his OCPD. He also doesn't seem to mind that his Death God Martial Art—""Stance of Sin"" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. Showing that there are some things he can tolerate. 
  
 He is usually very mature and precise in his ways. Kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. However, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits. 
  
 Due to his serious personality, Kid is unaffected by nudity. While other male characters get nose bleeds, Kid does not. During a battle with a female ""madness clown"" who was trying to distract Kid with her nearly naked body, Patti says, ""Kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! This won't affect him!"" but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. Considering Patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. When Kid had to return to DWMA, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, Kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by Liz. Later in the Death Room, Kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either Liz or Kim. 
  
 Of course, Kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being A-Sexual. Given that his father created both him and Asura A-sexually, and Shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when Spirit hired Blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. An example to prove this is when Kid had visited Soul and Maka's apartment, when Blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like Soul or Black Star, Kid looked rather disgusted. 
  
 He doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. He is seen expressing concern about Soul's scar at one point, and threatens Gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts Maka after Gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. He also threw Patti and Liz away from him before being sucked into the Book of Eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him. 
  
 Kid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with Maka or Black☆Star as Maka and Black☆Star have with each other. 
  
 It is mentioned by Maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but Kid as a highly skilled Meister is able to do so since Liz and Patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for Kid who gave them a better life. 
  
 His father, Death, has mentioned that Kid is a Shinigami (""death god"") and does not need to collect souls, but Kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. His father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two Witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. However, he seems perfectly fine with this. 
  
 Kid shares a side rivalry with Black☆Star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than Black☆Star or Maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the Madness of Order in the Book of Eibon, while Black☆Star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. This may be because of his OCPD, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. It is also possible that being a Shinigami, Kid was weaker against the Madness. 
  
 Although Kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. He wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil.

 Birthday: May 6 
  
 A kind hearted orphaned high school student who, at the start of the story, begins living in a tent. She is then found by Shigure and Yuki, who offer to take her in in exchange for housekeeping. She loves to cook and describes herself as an excellent housekeeper. She also has an after-school job as a janitor to pay her tuition fees to avoid being a burden on her grandfather. She is depicted as polite, optimistic, extremely kind, and selfless; several other characters, including Kyou, Rin and Hanajima, tell her she needs to look out for her own interests and not shoulder everyone else's burdens. 
  
 Tooru habitually speaks formally (see Honorific speech in Japanese), but not always correctly, a habit she picked up from her father, Katsuya, after he died when she was three, as a way of replacing him in her mother's eyes. Tooru's mother, Kyouko, raised her alone until she died in a car accident shortly after Tooru entered high school, a few months before the start of the story. Tooru repeatedly calls Kyouko the most important person in her life and treasures her photograph; when she falls in love with Kyou she feels guilty of being ""unfaithful"" to her mother's memory.

She was fully cyborged at a very young age and as she ""grew"" she went through a series of artificial bodies. This, more than anything, likely contributed to her great ease at controlling cyborg bodies of various types, even multiple at the same time. 
  
 More mysterious is her incredible ability as a hacker, as she is equally at ease in a cyborg body as she is without one while diving the net; she is also officially registered as a Super Wizard Class Hacker.

 Kenma has a very relaxed and laid back personality. He hardly ever loses his cool, and he usually never gets excited about anything (with the exception of Hinata and video games). He is quiet and reserved and does not voice his opinions often since he is afraid of how others would think of them. He isn't the type who can make friends easily, and his only friend back when he was younger had been Tetsurou Kuroo. Despite his modest personality, Kenma is actually quite skilled in volleyball, with his extraordinary game sense and technique, which makes up for his power, speed, and stamina.

 Back Story 
  
 Allen is the main hero of the series. He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed ""deformity"" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the ""Pentacle"" — the mark of the Akuma — which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white. 
  
 Allen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of.",15; 16; 17,,British,"168 cm (5'6""), now 174 cm (5'8 1/2"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/72171.jpg

 Height: 168 cm 
 Hair color: white 
 Eye color: red 
 Classification: Esper 
 Affiliation: GROUP (Former operative) 
 Occupation: Nagatenjouki Academy 
 Level: 5 
 Partner: Last Order 
 Ability: Vector Manipulation 
 Quote: ""Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you got stronger, right?"" 
 Theme Song: ""Saikyou no Nanori"" 
  
 Accelerator is the most powerful Psychic in Academy City and the main protagonist of Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator. His real name is unknown, though Accelerator recalls his surname was composed of two characters and his given name consisted of three characters. First appearing as an antagonist of the third light novel, he later becomes a main character and the lead of the science side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, especially in volumes 5, 8, 12, 13, SS1, SS2, 15, 14, 19, and 20. 
  
 A sadistic boy about the same age as Touma, he has an ability called ""Vector Change,"" a form of telekinesis allowing him to change the vector values of anything he touches due in part of having a thin coat of AIM fields surrounding his body. This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person's body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him. 
  
 Accelerator's unique ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 ESPer; according to the city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index's Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 ESPer without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to ""level up"" Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 3 ESPers: the Misaka clones. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the most powerful and feared ESPer that no one would be foolish enough to challenge and even killed many who got in his way.",15-16,,,168 cm,Nagatenjouki Academy,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/569601.jpg

 Blood type: B 
 Nationality: Japanese 
  
 Jousuke is the main protagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4 . He begins his story as a new freshman in the town of Morioh. Part 4 begins with Joutarou seeking him out, as Jousuke is the illegitimate son of Joutarou's grandfather, Joseph Joestar. 
  
 Jousuke makes his entrance into the JoJo universe as a caring, popular, and slightly naïve teenager. Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, he isn't afraid to fight for those in need. He is confronted by Joutarou with the need to eradicate evil Stand users from his hometown, Morioh. He refuses at first, believing that it is not any of his business. However, he quickly changes his mind when his policeman grandfather is killed by a criminal Stand user. With a vow paralleling that of Peter Parker, Jousuke decides to deliver justice to evil Stand users in his grandfather's place. 
  
 Jousuke is nice to people and says ""Mister"" and ""Miss"" like a normal, polite young man until someone pisses him off (which isn't very hard to do). The easiest way to do that is to mock his hair, which makes Jousuke angry and explosively violent. Jousuke grew up with his single mother, never knowing his father Joseph Joestar. Jousuke is crafty and has a sneaky streak for money, which is shown multiple times in the story. Nevertheless, he is a dependable and friendly person who is always willing to protect people who need it. 
  
 Jousuke's Stand power, Crazy Diamond, is a melee Stand with short range (2m). Crazy Diamond has the ability of ""restoration."" It can repair damage (by returning an object to a previous state) and by extension heal injuries (apart from Jousuke's own injuries). It is limited in that it cannot revive the dead or cure illnesses (as the sick are not considered as damaged). It can, however, restore an item to its raw materials (e.g., a table can be restored to timbers). This ability allows Crazy Diamond to perform a range of interesting feats, including trapping the enemy (by restoring pieces of a broken crate around the target) and tracking (e.g., restoring a torn piece of clothing so that it will seek out what it came from and reattach). Its restoration ability often ""malfunctions"" when Jousuke is angry, causing the object to be improperly put back together. The Stand's name is a reference to Pink Floyd's song, ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond.""

Madness and/or death are not uncommon results of such an attempt but, due to certain circumstances, Nanachi was able to keep their personality and mental faculties intact; their body, however, was deformed beyond recognition. 
  
 Not much is known about Nanachi's past—they were born in the Far North region of Sereni, lost their family and home at a young age and were taken to the Abyss by treachery. 
  
 Nanachi looks very young, but their vast knowledge of the physics and ecology of the Abyss seems to suggest they've lived there for quite a while. They also appear to be an accomplished healer with significant surgical skills and extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and such. Most of the time Nanachi is cool and reserved, keeping their distance both emotionally and physically. Their ironic attitude often borders on being sarcastic and even cynical; however, behind this mask, Nanachi hides a kind and gentle soul capable of deep compassion and selfless devotion.

 Birthday: July 1 (Cancer) 
 Height: 167 cm 
 Blood Type: B 
  
 Natsume Takashi is the main protagonist of the series who, like his deceased grandmother Natsume Reiko, has the ability to see ayakashi (spirits). He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed ""Nyanko-sensei"" (or simply ""sensei""), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then. 
  
 Orphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a ""liar"" and ""attention seeker"" for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively ""normal"" life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret. 
  
 Natsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei. 
  
 To return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process.

 Blood type: AB 
  
 A teenage girl who possesses the ""Mystic Eyes of Death Perception,"" a supernatural ability that allows her to view the death of any given object and destroy its origin. She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she had two personalities: a male personality known as SHIKI, and a female personality known as Shiki. Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the ""yang"" personality, while the female is called the ""yin"" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at any given time because both personalities have a distinct style of speech, most notably seen when the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi, while the male Shiki refers to himself as ore. 
  
 After awaking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the dead Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the female Shiki's. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.

 A member of the Karasuno High volleyball club, Tsukishima is very blunt and has a habit of riling people up (usually Hinata, Kageyama, and even his senpais Tanaka and Nishinoya). He dislikes “hot-blooded people” and doesn’t like to exert too much effort due to the past experiences of his older brother. Aside from others like Daichi, Sugawara, and Asahi, he has little to no respect for his other teammates and is shown to be quite irritated at having to be close to them (seen as Karasuno huddled up to build up their spirits and again when he expressed disgust in having to stay with the team during training camp). He can even be rude to Yamaguchi (the person closest to him) which really shows his spiteful personality. The second years think of him as someone with a warped personality. He also teases Kageyama both by calling him ""the king"" as well as referring to the rest of the players as common folk, which angers him to the core.

 Ulquiorra is a male arrancar with a melancholic appearance. Ulquiora is the 4th ranked espada. 
  
 Ulquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy's first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue's healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki's final release can easily get through Yammy's defenses. He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own. 
  
 It would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as ""trash,"" which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. Despite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another. 
  
 When released his zanpakutou, Murciélago (Japanese for ""giant black-winged demon,"" Spanish for ""bat""), creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrección Segunda Etapa (Spanish for ""resurrection second stage""). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long ""lances"" of energy called Lanza del Relámpago ,ransa deru reranpāgo?, Japanese and Spanish for ""lance of the lightning""), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target. 
  
 Theme song: ""Moonshield,"" on the album ""The Jester Race"" by the group ""In Flames.""

 Naofumi Iwatani is the main protagonist of The Rising of the Shield Hero. 
  
 He was a university student before being summoned to another world, where he had to fight against the waves of calamity, as one of the 4 cardinal heroes summoned. He was, however, the shield hero, regarded by many and especially people in Melromarc as the weakest of the heroes. 
  
 Due to his status as shield hero, many refused to join his side, the only exception being Myne Sophia. Myne however falsely accuses him of sexual assault causing him to lose his dignity and all his money 
 Due to this, the once cheerful Naofumi became a cynical character who lost the ability to trust in people.

 Hitsugaya comes from Junrinan, District 1 of Rukongai. There, he lived with an old woman (said to be his grandmother), Momo Hinamori, and possibly other people. Little else is known about his past, but it is known that he became a Shinigami shortly after Hinamori. He is also a friend of Jidanbou, the West Gate Keeper, and was the one who taught him the ""city rules."" 
  
 As a child, Hitsugaya was a bit of a brat who liked to eat watermelons and poke fun at Hinamori. She would call him ""Shiro-chan"" (シロちゃん, ""Lil' Shiro"" in the English dub) and he would counter by calling her ""Bed-wetter Momo."" The two were close friends and Hitsugaya, despite being younger and much shorter than his friend, always felt that he needed to protect her. His favorite foods are watermelon and sweet nattō. He also hates hot weather. 
  
 With Hitsugaya's natural talent, he quickly entered the Shinigami institute shortly after Hinamori, despite his age. She continued to call him ""Shiro-chan"" out of habit and felt she needed to protect him. Because of a promise she had made, she only began to call him ""Hitsugaya-kun"" after he had achieved his Zanpakutō's initial release and was recognized as a Shinigami. Highly capable and knowledgeable, he quickly became the youngest of the Captains within the Gotei 13 (Thirteen Court Guard Squads).

 One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict. 
  
 Seemingly little more than a thorn in her partners’ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in ""Cowboy Funk"") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler & Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/264961.jpg

After the Teleport Incident, Roxy helps Paul to search the world for survivors. 
  
 Roxy is a thin young Migurd woman of short height with pale skin and long, blue, water colored hair and eyes of the same color. Her outfit usually consists of a magicians hat and robe. Her hair is held in two ponytails that travel down her back.

 Birthday: August 31 
 Age: 16 
 Height: 192 cm (6'3 ½'') 
 Weight: 85 kg 
 Blood type: B 
 Zodiac: Virgo 
 School: Teiko (formerly), Touou Academy (currently) 
 Favorite food: Teriyaki burger 
 Hobby: looking up gravure/gravure idols 
 Number: #6 (Teiko), #5 (Touou) 
 Position: Power Forward 
 Talents: Skill and Agility, Unusual Speed, Formless Shots, Freestyle Basketball, Zone Play 
  
 Aomine was the ace of Teikou's team, embracing an aggressive and liquid style, made even more powerful by Kuroko's misdirection. In fact, Aomine was once Kuroko's ""Light,"" before Kagami. Incredibly fast and versatile, Aomine's strength lies in his unpredictability, as well as an uncanny ability to shoot from virtually any position. 
  
 In his second year in middle school, Aomine inspired Kise to play basketball and he became his training partner. Kise was still a complete rookie, apart from his copying ability, and Aomine was obviously stronger than him, but Aomine kept training with Kise, just because he loves basketball. He taught Kise a lot and became his mentor/idol. During that time, Aomine also became the ace of the team. 
  
 Though he loves basketball, he has grown sardonic and unenthusiastic toward the sport, skipping practice and even arriving late for important matches. This is due to his frustration in not being able to find an opponent capable of matching his skill, and thus making him conclude that the only one that can defeat him is he himself. 
  
 He and Momoi are childhood friends. Even though he doesn't show it, he's actually really fond of her, and they have a sibling-like relationship.

 Birthday: June 26 (Cancer) 
 Height: 175 cm 
 Weight: 56 kg 
 Blood Type: AB 
  
 Katsura is Gintoki's former comrade during the Joi war. Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices. 
  
 Katsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the ""Daybreak of the Joui Faction"" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death. 
 Since he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura.' 
  
 Katsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki). 
 Katsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant. 
  
 In the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him ""Zura."" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him ""Casserole,"" or ""Cough syrup."" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura ""Zura."" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies ""Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!"" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies ""Not Casserole! It's Katsura!"" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since ""Katsura"" can mean wig in Japanese and ""Zura"" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since ""Katsura"" and ""Casserole"" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner. 
  
 His name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro.

 Age (at the start of the show): 29 
  
 Yang Wenli is a commodore, currently serving in the 2nd fleet of the Free Planets Alliance. 
  
 The son of a merchant and a pacifist at heart, Yang never wanted to be a soldier; his dream was to become a historian, but he didn't have the money to pay for his tuition and joined the army to get a scholarship. He barely made it through the officer's academy due to his lack of interest, though he did make a number of friends there including Dusty Attenborough and Jean Robert Lap. He also met music student Jessica Edwards and both him and Lap developed a crush on her, Jessica eventually chose Lap, Yang accepted her decision and they remained friends. 
  
 Soon after he graduated, Yang became involved in a battle near the friendly planet El Facil, because of his superiors' incompetence and cowardice, the planet was abandoned while a hostile imperial fleet was on its way. Yang was one of the few officers that remained behind and tried to help the population, thanks to his efforts the planet was evacuated in time. Because of this achievement he became famous as ""the hero of El Facil"" and ""miracle Yang,"" forever earning the envy of his peers and the scorn of his superiors. 
  
 It was at El Facil that Yang first became interested in tactics, but ever since that incident and although he kept rising through the ranks, his novel tactical suggestions were being arbitrarily rejected by hostile superiors. Though disappointed and increasingly cynical with the state of affairs in the Alliance, Yang never stopped trying to do at least the absolute minimum to justify his salary and the pension he was so looking forward to. 
  
 Miracle Yang, also called ""the magician,"" is a genius tactician, as well as a competent strategist. Unlike his often proud adversaries, Yang is more than willing to resort to trickery and his only flaw as a commander lies with his inability to go against the orders of his superiors. Yang holds democracy in an extremely high esteem and has a well-defined political philosophy, providing much insight to anyone willing to listen to him. In his personal life he appears to be quite slothful, he is notoriously incompetent with house chores, as well as in all things romantic. After serving on the Patorokolos in the start of the series, Yang eventually gets the battleship Hyperion as he his given command of the 13th fleet, and this becomes his flagship during the coming conflic­ts.

 Mirai is a first-year high school student with the ability to manipulate blood, an ability that is unique even in the spirit world. This ability causes her to be isolated, leading her to jump off the roof of the high school until she is saved by Akihito. 
  
 Clumsy and a bit aloof, Mirai rarely stands out in school. In fact, she struggles pretty much in life; she has to earn her own money to make ends meet, but her constant fear of actually encountering a youmu prevents her from earning an income from slaying youmu, which most spirit world warriors take on as part of their profession. To make things worse, her hobby of writing blog articles about bonsai is often ridiculed on the Internet.

She is in charge of the general management and supervises the activities of the seven Floor Guardians, meaning that she ranks above all the other NPCs in Nazarick. She is the sister of Nigredo and Spinel. She was created by Tabula Smaragdina. 
  
 An impeccable beauty, Albedo is a woman with lustrous jet-black hair and the face of a goddess. She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings. 
  
 Albedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest. In combat, she wears an impressive black full plate armor with a unique helm and carries a battle-axe with her. 
  
 Like Shalltear, Albedo has a true form as a heteromorphic race NPC. Shalltear called her a ""big mouthed gorilla"" when they quarreled, so her true form may be quite large in size. 
  
 Extremely loyal and extremely in love, Albedo is completely infatuated with Momonga, often showing obsessive tendencies when it comes to his affairs. She is always vying for Momonga's affection, showcasing outbursts of jealousy whenever anyone else appears to be getting close to him. This is because the last thing Momonga did in Yggdrasil was to use his administrative privileges to edit her character history, adding the she is ""madly in love"" with him. 
  
 Among all the Guardians, Albedo is the most vocal when it comes to expressing opinions. She will openly denounce any statement or action deemed inappropriate, reaching the point where Momonga sometimes considers it an annoyance. 
  
 As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she is very levelheaded. Albedo can make calm and collected judgments that Ainz, sometimes, doesn't think of. She takes Ainz's orders as top priority and absolute, punishing anyone, even a Floor Guardian, who'd dare belittle his orders. Like many others in Nazarick, she absolutely loathes humans and views them as an inferior species.

During their rescue effort, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of an enemy ninja's attack, and Obito awakened his Sharingan to save Kakashi and defeat the ninja.

 Jersey Number: #10 
 Position: Power Forward 
 Birthday: April 1 
 High School: Shohoku 
 Shoe Brand: Jordan 
 The protagonist. At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan. 
  
 At first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy. 
  
 In spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory.

Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique.

 Ippo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer. 
  
 His Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.",,,,"164 cm (5'5"")",Professional Boxer; Makunouchi Fishing Boat,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/32678.jpg

He is shouldered with a 3,850,000 yen debt at the beginning of the story by a coworker who convinced him into co-signing a loan, leaving Kaiji with the full weight of the debt compounded over a year.

 Rider was originally meant to be summoned by Lord Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, but due to some circumstances, he ended up being Waver Velvet's servant. 
  
 Iskandar, or how he refers to himself, the King of Conquerors is a noble and courageous man, who prefers to conquer his enemies by winning without killing and controlling without humiliating them. He is known as a marvelous ruler who once almost conquered the whole known world. 
  
 He is not pragmatic, but is a person who lets history run its course and acts according to his impulses. While he is wild and somewhat inconsiderate to others, his greed ultimately resulted in the happiness of the people he ruled over. 
  
 In the new era, Rider is mostly amazed by ordinary modern things, and usually spends his free time exploring modern war vehicles and machinery.

 Yuusuke has brown eyes and short black hair, which he usually keeps slightly-spiked with hair gel. He has around half a dozen small bangs which he doesn't keep spiked. Instead of wearing the school-issued blue uniform of Sarayashiki Junior High, he wears a identically-designed green uniform. He does this in direct rebellion of the school's strict dress code. Throughout the series, Yuusuke's clothing changes, but he usually wears some type of fighter's garb. Yuusuke looks rather-skinny, a stark contrast to his unusual strength. At the beginning of the series, he was also quite short as seen when Keiko points out he was shorter than she was. 
  
 Having no father and with his mother always off somewhere else, getting drunk or partying, Yuusuke has grown up in a very neglectful environment. He's short tempered, impulsive, and likes to intimidate those who are afraid of him. One of his most notable traits is his desire to fight, which becomes more noticeable as the series progresses. Yuusuke has been noted on many occasions to being rather unintelligent and, at times, just plain stupid. Yuusuke's desire to fight is more out of enjoyment of a good brawl, and surprisingly Yuusuke doesn't like killing if he can avoid it. 
  
 Even though Yuusuke is feared by most students; and severely disliked by almost all of the teachers, he is generally misunderstood. Keiko Yukimura is one of the very few who knows Yuusuke is actually very kind, and she sympathizes with his problems in life. Yuusuke and Keiko quickly develop strong feelings for each other; and he is fiercely protective of her, almost always worrying about her well-being. Yuusuke initially didn't like Kuwabara, but as the series progresses, the two develop a mutual bond and respect for each other, with Kuwabara being the only person who truly understands him. Yuusuke and Hiei have a serious rivalry and, at times, Yuusuke seems almost intimidated by Hiei's remarkable skills. Yet, each of them has respect for the other, and will put their lives on the line to help one another. Yuusuke is very close to Kurama and has a great amount of confidence in him. Yuusuke respects Kurama's wisdom, sometimes looking to him for leadership advice when he's not sure what to do.

 Gender: Male 
 Birthday: May 5 (Children's Day in Japan) 
 Zodiac: Taurus 
 Age: 27 
 Blood type: A 
 Height: 177 cm 
 Weight: 64 kg 
 Others: right-handed, chain smoker 
 Affiliations: Shinsengumi 
  
 Hijikata is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo. 
  
 Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of ""demonic vice-commander."" He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional. 
  
 Hijikata is obsessed with mayonnaise and thus has the nickname ""Mayora."" He has been known to smother anything he eats under a mountain of mayonnaise, and he carries a number of objects shaped like jars of mayonnaise, such as his cigarette lighter. He was popular with girls until they discovered this obsession. 
  
 He enjoys fighting and sees Gintoki as a rival in practically everything he does from drinking contests to rock, paper, scissors ever since being defeated by him in battle. He is in constant danger of being killed by the attempts on his life by Okita. But, despite all this, he sees Okita as one of his close friends, and vice versa. 
  
 Before joining Shinsengumi, he used to be a trouble-maker ronin. He enjoys fighting/having a good fight and says he doesn't care how many Amanto buildings get blown up, he only looks forward to having a big battle with the Joui rebels after Shinsengumi has rounded them in 1 fell swoop, in Episode 5. 
  
 He also formulated the Kyokuchuu Hatto, the 45 Regulations that form the disciplinary framework for Shinsengumi members, and implements them firmly. 
  
 He smokes and eats mayonnaise.

 Birthday: December 31 
 Height: 158 cm 
 Weight: 44 kg 
 Blood type: O 
 Motto: One good deed per day. 
  
 Sawako is a shy yet honest girl who is in search of friendship, but her resemblance to horror film character Sadako, Sawako's modesty, and her tendency to shy away from correcting people of misconceptions prevent her from doing so to the point most of the school believed her name was in fact Sadako. Thanks to Kazehaya's kind and open nature, she is able to gradually open up to her classmates, and talk to different people. 
  
 With help from Kazehaya, Yano, and Yoshida she gradually begins to make friends. She is grateful (and at first, worships) Kazehaya for giving her the opportunities to make close friends, which came to include Yano, Yoshida, Kazehaya, and Ryu. Yano and Yoshida admit that Sawako's ""like"" towards Kazehaya might be even more than Yano and Yoshida themselves. 
  
 She is rather short, in part because her father is as well and is surprisingly fast, which is revealed during a soccer match at the school's sports festival. During Yano and Yoshida's first visit to Sawako's house, Yoshida notes that Sawako's lips and figure looks like her mother's and most of Sawako's other features resemble her father's. A running gag is that she seems to take what people say seriously as well as over-analyze a situation, which tends to scare the people around her when she is deep in thought.",15-17,,,158 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/120945.jpg

She would selflessly do everything in her power to help her friends. Jolyne believed that her loved ones had a good heart and an honest nature.

 The student council president of Shuchiin Academy. 
  
 Monstruously smart, placing among the top in the nation in mock exams, he's skilled in management as well, so he is respected by others as a genius, but it is more correct to say that he's addicted to hard work. 
  
 He will never turn down an opportunity to listen to people who come to talk to him or do favors for them, and sincerely invests himself in others' well-beings. He cannot leave others in trouble, and has a knack for finding those in trouble as well. He studies for ten hours a day and works part-time jobs too, resulting in a life where no one knows how or when he even sleeps. 
  
 He's in love with Kaguya, the school council vice president, but refuses to express his feelings to her because he thinks that the one who confesses to the other is going to be the weaker person in the relationship.

 Birthday: X767 
 Occupation: Mage 
 Affiliation: Fairy Tail Guild 
 Known relatives: Layla Heartfilia (Mother), Jude Heartfilia (Father) 
 Magic: Celestial Spirit Magic 
 Height: 165 cm 
 BWH: 91-59-88 
  
 Lucy is a mage and the main female character of Fairy Tail, joining at the start of the main story line. Lucy's member stamp is located on the back of her right hand. 
  
 At the beginning of the series, Lucy is an independent novice mage searching for a mage guild to join, particularly interested in Fairy Tail, which she claims as the strongest mage guild. Though she tells Happy she considered joining Fairy Tail's rival guild, Phantom Lord, due to their similar outrageous nature and personality, she is content with her decision of joining Fairy Tail. After being rescued by Natsu from the slave ship, she is invited to join the guild. Once joining Fairy Tail, Lucy becomes a member of Natsu's team. 
  
 Lucy is one of the saner and more stable members of Fairy Tail, having common sense that other members of the guild seem to lack. She consistently points out Natsu's and others' idiocy. Lucy is also very confident in her appearance and sexiness, exuding a certain amount of vanity. Despite this superficial attitude, Lucy is passionate for literature and is in the process of writing her own novel about her adventures with Fairy Tail. She is a member of the Heartfilia family, one of the richest and most influential conglomerate families in the country of Fiore. However, due to her estranged relationship with her father and the death of her mother, she left home to follow her own path. 
  
 It should also be noted that she was the only other person who had ever shut Gray and Natsu up without beating them up first. Natsu and Gray seem a little scared of her when she's under the weather, even if Lucy's magic is not as strong as theirs and can't force them into submission like Erza. 
  
 Lucy practices Stellar Spirit magic, a skill which allows her to summon spirits from another world using Keys of the Gates. Her Stellar Spirits have varying levels of power, with different ones suited for different tasks. For example, Aquarius can control water, while Taurus has enormous strength. Along with her keys, she also carries a whip, which she is proficient with. Lucy explains to Natsu that Stellar Spirit mages have the potential to obtain extremely rare Gold Keys, which open the gates of the ""Ecliptic Zodiac"", and common, store-bought Silver keys. Each gold key has the Zodiac symbol of the one it is used to summon on it. According to Lucy, while there is a large number of silver keys, there are only 12 gold keys. Thus far in the series, Lucy has obtained 10 Gold Keys and 4 Silver Keys. She also summoned all of her Gold keys (5 of them at the time) and Plue at once, although it only lasted a few seconds, it showed her to be very powerful. Loki's previous owner was a very powerful mage, yet she could not summon more than one at a time.",17-18,,,165 cm,Mage,"Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/5186/Lucy_Heartfilia: Page.goto: net::ERR_TIMED_OUT at https://myanimelist.net/character/5186/Lucy_Heartfilia

 He is one of students in Class 3-E. Nagisa is seen as one of the weakest students in the class due to his small stature and mediocre physical abilities that are comparable to some of the girls in the class. However, he is actually the most talented to become an assassin out of all the students, something that acknowledged by Korosensei and Karasuma. He is able to draw closer while hiding his bloodlust to make a surprise attack and able to make his opponents falter through his bloodlust alone. 
  
 Nagisa usually writes Korosensei's weaknesses that at first seem minor (since it doesn't look like major weaknesses), but eventually revealed to be useful since once they're able to almost kill Korosensei because of one of his weaknesses that is the same as the one that Nagisa has written down in his note. 
  
 Outwardly friendly and polite to his friends and everyone, he hides a somewhat darker side of him as an assassin that won't be able to be found out during daily classes and will only shown during training and assassination time. According to Karasuma, whenever Nagisa unleashes his killing intent, he isn't training and truly goes for a kill.",14-15,,,159 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/303282.jpg

He doesn't speak in order to prevent accidentally cursing someone with his enchanted words.

 Quirk: Erasure 
  
 The homeroom teacher for class 1-A. He always looks extremely tired but hates to waste time. He is a Hero known as Eraserhead whose Quirk Erasure is to nullify others' Quirks so long as they remain in his line of sight. If he blinks, his Quirk deactivates, so he always wears goggles to prevent enemies from figuring out whose quirk he is nullifying, effectively creating confusion. Continued use of his Quirk gives him dry eye, which makes him unable to use it for some time after. 
  
 He is a person moved primarily by logic, as he tries not to fuss about his appearance. He tends to be blunt and rather flatlined when it comes to his ideals and explanations about things. When he has a particular belief, he will state it without holding anything back. He often comes off as cold and apathetic, showing very little energy and sometimes letting his own students resolve certain issues by themselves. 
  
 In spite of his apathetic traits, Shota does seem to genuinely care about his students, and will go to great lengths to protect them from danger. He did not hesitate to react to the Villains presence both at the USJ, and at the Field Trip lodge. He also has expressed his belief in his students on multiple occasions

 Itsuki Nakano is the fifth sister of the Nakano Quintuplets. She is attributed as the ""first girl"" of the series. Itsuki is serious and diligent, yet she's also a glutton and crybaby. 
  
 Itsuki is a serious girl, usually getting up early compared to her sisters. She also has good manners, to the point where she cares a lot about manners. She has never been late or skipped a class, and always speaks polite language. 
  
 Itsuki has been seen to be a girl who holds a grudge, this is shown when she rejects Fuutarou Uesugi's teaching, in part, due to their earlier dispute. She is also someone who cannot be honest with herself and has a hard time being more direct. Both of these qualities often make her fight alone. Itsuki is often too precise in the timing of food cooking. 
  
 Itsuki sometimes tends to be a crybaby, whether it's due to unfavorable situations, scary things, or her stubborn self. 
  
 Itsuki has a large appetite and is mainly seen eating throughout the series. It seems like she doesn't mind treating her sisters unfairly when it comes to things related to food. When Itsuki proposes to share their cakes, Ichika suspects that his real goal is to try all the flavors. Itsuki worries about Fuutarou, but it's really because he's hungry. 
  
 According to Ichika, Fuutarou has to be firm to deal with Nino and kind to deal with Itsuki.

 Birthday: June 15 
 Blood Type: O 
 Height: 157 cm 
 Likes: Raku Ichijou, animals 
 Abilities: Natural Affinity for Animals, Japanese sweets 
  
 She is one of the main characters in the manga series Nisekoi. She is shown to have a crush on Raku Ichijou, the male protagonist of Nisekoi, and is also the only girl that Ichijou openly has feelings for. 
  
 Onodera is discreet, innocent, and slightly timid. She is very kind, she takes care of Ichijou when he is wounded or ill. Generally, she opts to think carefully before acting, as seen when she stalls her confession to Ichijou in consideration that he may have feelings for Kirisaki. 
  
 In confrontation with Ichijou, Onodera lacks confidence, initially needing encouragement from Miyamoto to attempt confessing her love. 
  
 Onodera works well with her classmates, possessing close friends and being the most popular girl for the boys before Kirisaki transferred and after Kirisaki and Ichijou allegedly began dating. 
  
 Both Kosaki and Ichijou are completely unaware that the feelings they hold for each other are mutual. Like in many average fictional love stories, these two try not to show their feelings to each other. She loves Raku because he is kind and caring. Just like the other girls who like him, she can be jealous as well but not to the point of having bloodlust. She often worries/wonders whether Raku and Chitoge's ""fake relationship"" is actually developing into something more than just that. 
  
 Chitoge and Onodera have a really trusting relationship. It can even be considered that they are best friends since Chitoge only tells her problems to her (except in some cases, Raku as well). Despite her knowing that Chitoge and Raku are only pretending to date, she at times can't help but be suspicious of their relationship.",15-17,,,157 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/241653.jpg

As a young child, his mother remarried to an Italian man, and they moved to Italy; hence, Haruno Shiobana became Giorno Giovanna. 
  
 Giorno's great ambition in life is to become a mafia boss (a ""Gang Star""), and as such, he eventually joins the mob squad Passione. Though he is its youngest and newest member, he quickly proves his mettle and eventually becomes the de facto leader of the group. 
  
 Unlike typical mafia bosses, he wanted to give divested riches to the poor, giving him an agenda similar to Robin Hood. He eventually influences all of Passione—all but their boss, who later became their worst enemy.

 Birthday: June 6 
 Zodiac sign: Gemini 
 Class: 2-B 
 Height: 174 cm

 Interests: Bishoujo games (Gal games) and 2D girls 
 Hates: All Real girls, reality, sweets 
 Favorite quotes: ""I will teach you something useful"" ; ""I can see the ending"" 
  
 Keima Katsuragi, the protagonist of the story, is a 17-year-old high school student attending Maijima High School Academy. At an early age, he acquired an obsessive interest in video games; now he is known as ""The Capturing God (落とし神, Otoshi-gami?)"" in the gaming world for his legendary skills in ""capturing"" any girls in dating sims. But ironically, he is called otamegane (a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku and megane-""glasses"") by almost everyone in his school due to his extreme devotion to videogames. Despite himself saying he likes girls, it's the perfectly theoretical and beautiful girls of the game world that he prefers, not the girls in reality. His love for games is such that he even goes into withdrawal if he doesn't play games enough and he has the bad habit of locking himself in his room and playing games for days on end when he's depressed. 
  
 At the start of the series, Keima becomes a collaborator for catching runaway spirits when he replies to an instigative e-mail to his mail address in his PFP (otoshi-god@zumcities.co.jp) requesting his help to ""capture"" girls without knowing it was a contract from Hell, to which Elsee appeared and asked for his aid to ""capture"" girls in real-life. For each individual of the ""Capture Targets""—a girl with the runaway spirit in her—Keima utilizes his analytical skills and experiences from dating sims to ""capture"" them. When he has figured out the final push needed to ""capture"" a girl (in both reality and games), he says the catchphrase ""I can already see the ending."" Whenever he isn't capturing runaway spirits, he is almost always seen playing video games on his PFP (a parody of Sony's PSP), which might explain his weak physique. 
  
 Also, despite the fact he even plays video games in class, he is still at the top of class in every subject. During a scolding of a teacher for his gaming habits, Keima reasoned that all would be fine as long as he aced all his exams; he then proceeded to do so, demonstrating a great academic ability. It is shown that Keima's analytical skills he utilises to ""capture"" girls is also applied by him in his studies, proven true when he flawlessly predicted the questions on the upcoming English test based on the teacher's personality and the examination extent. As the story progresses, his perspective of the ""real world"" girls becomes different. Nevertheless, he remains faithful to his ""2D girls,"" in particular, a girl named ""Yokkyun"" who seems to be drawn in a parody style of famed visual novel Kanon. 
  
 His mastery and devotion to girl games was revealed to be way higher above than just average otakus. He is able to play six games at the same time with each of different screens with the activation of his ""Capturing God Mode."" His PFP breaks numerous times during the series, but later found that he actually has a lot of spare PFP hidden around his body. He frequently does lengthy lecture on various archetypes of characters and philosophies on capturing girls. However, he is completely ignorant to everything else, including real girls and their body, foods and even his own life.",17,,,174 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/122018.jpg

 Height: Unknown (as Conan); 174 cm (as Shinichi) 
 Weight: 18 kg (as Conan) 
 Date of Birth: May 4 
 Relatives: Yuusaku Kudou (father) & Yukiko Kudou (mother) 
 Nicknames: Cool Kid (Jodie Starling), Cool Guy (Vermouth), Silver Bullet-kun (Vermouth), Glasses Kid (Sonoko Suzuki), Holmes' Apprentice (Apollo & Minerva Glass) 
  
 At the beginning of the series, Shinichi Kudou is a 17-year-old student at Teitan High School. He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the ""Savior of the police force,"" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old. 
  
 Shinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization. 
  
 As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou's reputation who will later on be referred to as ""Sleeping Kogorou."" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa. 
  
 Conan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring. 
  
 Conan's intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers ""Heisei Holmes"" and ""Savior of the Japanese police force."" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as ""something [he] heard on TV"" or ""taught by uncle Kogoro/professor Agasa/Shinichi-niichan."" 
  
  
 Likewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his ""being quite smart for a child,"" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye. 
  
 Conan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more ""practice"" in.

 Current concern: ……how d'you spell “concern”?? 
 Ability Parameters (out of 5): power = 5; jump = 4; stamina = 5; intellect = 3; technique = 3; speed = 4 
  
 Bokuto Koutaro is a 3rd year Captain and Wing Spiker of Fukurodani Volleyball Team. Together with Kuroo, he teaches Tsukishima Kei Volleyball despite the fact that Karasuno High is a formidable opponent. 
  
 He has a playful, energetic and child-like personality and is described by his team as having mood swings, where even the slightest thing can change his mood which then impacts his performance. He is often referred to as 'simple-minded' because of this, but is both admired by his own team and the opponents for his impressive skills and morale-boosting demeanor. 
  
 When he makes a comeback, he clearly shows his pride as the ace and believes he is the 'strongest'. Bokuto is energetic (similar to Hinata), often making jokes about everything and acting rather dramatically about his plays. His personality is so compatible that he gets along with many people. However, he's rather ignorant to other people's discomfort, such as with Tsukishima.

 Homeland: Tokyo, Japan 
 Family: Takamura Suguru (older brother), Takamura Kyouka (older sister), Takamura Wataru (little brother) 
 Occupation: Professional Boxer 
 Weight Class: Junior Middleweight/Super Welterweight (Weight Limit 154 Pounds), Middleweight (Weight Limit 160 Pounds) and Super Middleweight (Weight Limit 168 Pounds) 
 Natural Weight: 200 Pounds 
 Height: 185 cm (6'1"") 
 Reach: 189 cm (74"") 
 Style: Hybrid 
 Stance(s): Orthodox Stance, Brawling Stance, Hitman Style 
 Current Affiliation: Kamogawa Boxing Gym 
 Trainer: Kamogawa Genji 
  
 He is a multi-weight class (currently Super Middleweight) hybrid boxer affiliated with the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He is the Former unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion. Takamura is currently WBC Super Middleweight Champion. Takamura's Goal is to be a 6 Weight Class World Champion from Junior Middleweight all the way to Heavyweight (to his Natural Weight) no matter the cost 
  
 Takamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss. 
  
 Takamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will. 
  
 As the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around. 
  
 He is the current WBC Super Middleweight Champion, former WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.",,,,"185 cm (6'1"")",Professional Boxer,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/229037.jpg

 Haruhi Fujioka, the main heroine of the story, is an intelligent freshman attending the prestigious and expensive Ouran High School.

However, unlike the other students, she is from a commoner family and got into Ouran through a scholarship. On her first day at school, she accidentally breaks a vase worth 8 million yen belonging to the Host Club. As a result, she is forced to work as a host to pay off her debt, and does so by disguising herself as a boy. Soon enough, she naturally takes to acting as a host to other girls, and even finds it enjoyable. However, she does not like to take time away from studying and often finds the antics of the other hosts to be annoying. Haruhi lives with her okama (cross dressing) father. As a result of her mother passing away when she was young, Haruhi has become very independent and never lets anyone worry about her.

 Family: Izayoi (mom), InuTaisho (dad), and Sesshoumaru (half-brother) 
  
 The title character, a hybrid of a youkai-dog and a human, a half-demon (""han'yo"" in Japanese). He wields the Tessaiga (known as the ""Tetsusaiga"" in the Viz translation), a supernatural sword made from one of his deceased father's fangs. This sword, when properly wielded, can destroy one hundred demons with a single swing, and has further powers which are revealed as the story progresses. It is also a source of which hatred exists between Inuyasha and his brother Sesshomaru, a full youkai dog demon, being that Inuyasha can wield the Tessaiga and Sesshomaru can not. Inuyasha has a tendency for massive regeneration and can recover from injuries which would be fatal for any average human. This ability is likely derived from his youkai powers (Example: Episode 5, when Kagome brings medicine from her time). On the night of the new moon each month, Inuyasha will change into a normal human with black hair, brown eyes, and loses his yokai power during this time. Prior to meeting his current companions, he would conceal himself during this time. Inuyasha loves Kikyo, and still does, but things get complicated when he starts to develop feelings of love for Kagome. He has mastered different abilities for his sword including the red tessaiga that can destroy barriers and also learning the backlash wave which hurls an opponents demonic energy right back at it.

 Height: 180 cm 
 Weight: 65 kg 
 Chest: 84 cm 
 Blood type: O 
 Specialty: Super High School-Level Luck 
  
 Nagito has the title of Super High School-Level Luck. However, his luck resembles a curse disguised as a gift, as it's a constant turn between extreme ""good luck"" and extreme ""bad luck."" 
  
 Nagito first comes off a polite, meek and kind yet somewhat insecure boy. He attempts to be the team's conflict mediator and optimistic poster boy, often encouraging others to be hopeful and cooperate, but he isn't really taken seriously and is even made fun of by Hiyoko Saionji who considers his dramatic pep talks about hope and friendship embarrassing and lame. Nagito often appears unusually carefree, though he claims to be a pessimist. He seems to lack tact and can sometimes say things that seem awkward, strange or even unsettling, though he doesn't seem to realize this and acts like it's just normal casual talk. Despite this, he appears harmless, and Hajime Hinata even mentions that his bright smile is very comforting. He is generally quite submissive and a push-over with a self-depreciating attitude. He wants to avoid conflict and goes along with other people (even agreeing with Hiyoko when she makes fun of him), but at times he can also be more forceful. He is quick to scold Hajime when he's being too pessimistic or when he thought he was bullying Mikan Tsumiki. He is notably annoyed by Teruteru Hanamura's treatment of girls and decides to keep an eye on him to make sure he won't harass anyone. He is also the only one to stay with unconscious Hajime and expresses concern for his physical and mental well-being, even after Hajime told him to go away. Though friendly with everyone, he is mostly interested in spending time with Hajime and can even appear a bit clingy towards him. Hajime considers him a little annoying and maybe not the most reliable, but still a kind person.

316,Sesshoumaru(殺生丸),InuYasha Movie 3: Tenka Hadou no KenInuYasha: Kuroi TessaigaInuYasha,7198,https://myanimelist.net/character/1358/Sesshoumaru,"Inuyasha's older half-brother. Unlike Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru is a full-blooded dog-demon and is contemptuous of InuYasha for being a half-demon and for consorting with humans. He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three, he could not defeat Naraku. Although fandom refers to him as the Lord of the Western Lands, this title appears at no point in the manga. Takahashi also stated that Sesshoumaru has no permanent home. Unlike almost every other demon in the world of InuYasha, he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel. 
  
 Sesshoumaru first appears in search of the sword called Tessaiga, created from their father Inu-no-Taisho's fang, which has the power to kill a hundred yōkai with one swing; however, Inu-no-Taisho left Tessaiga to Inuyasha, and Sesshoumaru instead inherited the Tenseiga, a sword which cannot harm the living, but can bring the dead back to life. Inu-no-Taisho did this in the hopes that Sesshoumaru would learn compassion. Considering Tenseiga useless to him, Sesshoumaru battles Inuyasha several times for possession of Tessaiga, and when Tessaiga is broken by a bite from Naraku's incarnation Goshinki, Sesshoumaru has Goshinki's fangs forged into the evil blade Tokijin, which only he is powerful enough to control. Initially, Sesshoumaru is ruthless and cruel in his pursuit of Tessaiga and his dealings with his brother. 
  
 Despite having a hatred for humans, he seems to care for Rin, a little human girl who was orphaned after her village was destroyed by demons. Rin found Sesshomaru in the woods by the village she lived in, and noticed that he was injured (due to a previous fight with Inuyasha) and she tried to help him. Sesshomaru refused her help, but after finding her body nearly devoured by Koga's wolves later on, he used Tenseiga to bring her back to life. Now Rin follows Sesshomaru around and thinks of herself as one of his servants.

 Kumiko enrolled in Kitauji High School to wear the sailor uniforms she liked and to get a fresh start.

 Ayumu Kasuga is a transfer student from Osaka. Tomo, expecting her to act like the stereotypical Osakan—loud, exuberant and fond of jokes—chose for her the nickname ""Osaka"", although Ayumu's behavior could not be more different. Ayumu considers the name ""slow"" and ""spacey"", but she lacks the energy or motivation to dispute it. The nickname sticks so well that she is called Osaka by teachers and even in the class roster, to the point that no one remembers her real name. In the manga, Osaka mentions that she lived in Kobe when she was in elementary school and was born in Wakayama. Tomo, who says she doesn't know where Wakayama is, tells Ayumu to ""just be Osaka"".",,,,156 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/27890.jpg

 Height: 175 cm (5' 9"") 
 Weight: 70 kg (155 lbs) 
 Birth year: 757 Age 
 Hobbies: reading, fishing, researching 
 Favorite foods: all types of food 
 Favorite vehicle: House Wagon 
  
 Gohan is the dual main character of Dragon Ball Z along with his father, Gokuu. 
  
 Gohan is a shy and studious intellectual, and as a child lacks the fighting spirit that is common among most Saiyans. However, because he is forced to protect the ones he loves, he taps into his vast half-breed Saiyan potential, becoming one of the most powerful main characters in the series. As an adult, he abandons his superhero duties and uses his mind, as a premier scholar. Gohan is extremely powerful, sometimes surpassing Gokuu, Piccolo, and Vegeta at certain points in the story. 
  
 At first, the relationship with Piccolo is a frightening one, but after Piccolo saves Gohan's life from Nappa at the cost of his own, Piccolo admits his change because of Gohan's acceptance of him during the one year they were training together. From here on out, Piccolo acts as an uncle (Oji-san in the Japanese version) to Gohan. Krillin also acted as a strong confidant in Gohan, particularly during the Namek arc and the beginning of the Buu arc. 
  
 Gohan also shares a strong relationship with his father in Gokuu, citing his walking up to Freeza on Namek as a source of inspiration and strength. He also spends close to a full year just with him in the Room of Spirit and Time during the Androids arc, and the two really get to enjoy each other's company. Gohan's respect and love for his father are all the more shown when he elects to wear Gokuu's orange gi when he sets off to fight Buu. 
  
 His hobbies are reading, fishing, and researching scholarly subjects. Though he claims he does not share the love of fighting Gokuu has, Gohan does feel obligated to help when danger arrives. He also enjoys being a hero, as seen by his comedic and unimpressive Great Saiyaman stunt. Another prominent facet of his personality was the fear of his own great potential power, which was seen when he was afraid that he might kill Cell during their battle in the Androids arc.

 Birthday: September 27, 1980 
 Height: 178 cm 
  
 Bruno Bucciarati makes his first appearance as a member of the fictional gang ""Passione,"" interrogating Giorno Giovanna about the death of another gang member; ""Weepy Eye"" Luka. Afterwards, Giorno convinces Bucciarati to help him overthrow the boss of ""Passione,"" in a plot to take over the gang. Eventually defecting from ""Passione,"" Bucciarati leads a group of rogue gang members against the boss, who is revealed to be a man named Diavolo. 
  
 As a child, Bruno was born in a poor fishing village, but he looked up to his father because of the love he had for his family. When his father became mixed up in the drug business and was badly injured, Bruno protected his father from the people that were trying to kill him, by killing them himself. This led him into the world of gangsters. Even though he was a member of ""Passione,"" he had a kind personality; many people came to him for help. 
  
 Sticky Fingers is the name of Bucciarati's Stand. It has the ability to place a fully functional zipper with a touch. For example: Sticky Fingers can hit a wall, placing a zipper on it. It can then open the zipper, allowing entrance through or into the wall. Its ability is not limited to inanimate objects; it can be used on humans. Bucciarati is able to use its ability on himself. Its ability can also be used offensively, to take things apart, or to mismatch things. 
  
 Bucciarati delivers his catch phrase while his Stand beats his opponents senseless with its fists. He begins stringing ""Ari ari ari"" to its rapid punches, saying ""Arrivederci"" on finish; ""Arrivederci"" meaning ""Goodbye"" in Italian.

322,Shana(シャナ),Shakugan no ShanaShakugan no Shana-tanShakugan no Shana: Koi to Onsen no Kougai Gakushuu!,7052,https://myanimelist.net/character/1426/Shana,"Age: 11-12 (immortal) 
 Height: 141 cm 
 Weight: 37 kg 
 Weapon of Choice: Nietono No Shana 
 Contracted to: Alastor 
  
 Shana is a young girl with jet black hair which is almost as long as her entire body height. She also has dark brown pupils and a fair complexion. Because of the effects of being a Flame Haze, Shana's body age remains that of a girl of 11 to 12 years old. Upon invoking her powers as a Flame Haze, her hair and eyes change color to a fiery crimson, with embers fluttering from her head down. 
  
 In her first few years as a Flame Haze, she wears an all-black attire consisting of a shirt, pants, and her Treasure Tool Yogasa in the form of a trench coat. However, after she decided to stay in Misaki City, she is most usually seen with the Misaki City Municipal High School uniform and when in combat, has the Yogasa as a cape worn over her clothes. 
  
 She is later seen wearing a red-and-black frilly dress on her stay inside the Seireiden. 
  
 Initially, she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, not even considering getting a name as she didn't see any importance having it. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, albeit marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person despite being a Torch and eventually, comes to show affection to him. Her duty made her indifferent toward human life at first, but through Yuuji's influence, Shana has opened up slightly, although she still remains confused and disgruntled by some human traits which she considers as pointless, although some of it is used to mask her jealousy of her desired monopoly on Yuuji. 
  
 Shana has a habit of saying ""Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!"" (""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"") whenever Yuuji asks her questions or makes remarks that disturb her original worldview or embarrass her. But in reality they really care for each other. She has a great fondness for anything sweet, eventually putting melon bread above her preference. 
  
 Shana is shown to be highly intelligent as she has gotten a perfect score on every exam and is talented in Physical Education. She is shown, however, to be naive when it comes to social affairs, once even unabashfully asking Chigusa, ""How are babies made?"" 
  
 Known only as the ""Flaming-Haired, Blazing-Eyed Hunter,"" Shana bears no name until she meets Yuuji, who names her after the sword she wields. As a ""Flame Haze,"" Shana is sworn to protect the balance of the world by hunting down the ""Guze no Tomogara,"" monsters from the ""Crimson Realm"" who come to earth in order to harvest the ""Power of Existence"" from its denizens. Together with Alastor, ""Flame of the Heavens"" and Shana's guide who lives within her and speaks to her through a necklace she wears, she has become one of the most powerful Flame Haze in existence. 
  
 Shana is said to be the most powerful, known and feared by most Crimson Denizens with her title alone. This has allowed her to defeat many powerful Denizens and permits her many different abilities, including her proficiency with the Nietono no Shana, the ability to wield flames, manipulate the Power of Existence, harbor extrasensory traits, and fly with wings of flame. In the third volume of the manga, the first volume of the novel, and the movie, Alastor states that the reason why she did not explode after being shot by Friagne's Trigger Happy was because she held a capacity that existed in dimensional space, who was able to contain the Flame of Heaven's (and more); he has thus stated her as ""The Great One.""",11-12 (immortal),,,141 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/68310.jpg

331,"Nakano, Azusa(中野 梓)",K-On!K-On!: Live House!K-On!: Ura-On!,6817,https://myanimelist.net/character/21173/Azusa_Nakano,"Age: 15-17 
 Birthday: November 11 (Scorpio) 
 Height: 150 cm 
 Weight: 46 kg 
 Blood type: AB 
 Favorite music: western music, jazz 
 Favorite food: cakes 
 Subjects she is good at: above average in all subjects 
 Subjects she is bad at: no subject in particular 
 Athletic ability: above average. 
 Hobbies: guitar practice. 
 Weaknesses and dislikes: lax atmosphere of the Light Music Club. 
  
 Azusa is a new student who joins the Light Music Club as a rhythm guitarist. She plays a Fender Mustang MG69/MH/CAR electric guitar which she eventually names Muttan, but is also in possession of a Gibson Les Paul Custom 50th Anniversary Gold Top (as seen in episode 13). She is a self-proclaimed novice guitarist who has been playing the guitar since the fourth grade and whose parents play in a jazz band. She is in the same year and class as Yui's sister, Ui, and has quite a mysterious demeanor. She often finds herself bewildered by the tea parties and cosplaying aspects of the club when she would rather just practice, and is struck by how good the club's music sounds despite their problems and lack of practice. However, she has a certain weakness for cakes and can be calmed down rather easily, sometimes by just being petted. She is more serious than the other girls, and does not like to admit how she really feels; she could be described in part as a tsundere. She is constantly hugged by Yui and is nicknamed Azu-nyan after trying on a pair of cat ears and meowing. 
  
 In the band, she looks up to Mio the most due to her maturity and the fact that she is an experienced musician, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, she sometimes unintentionally makes remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one-year-older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton-chan. 
  
 She is interested in a wide range of genres without limiting herself to anything in particular. She started playing instruments in fourth grade of elementary school, which makes it about 5 years of experience. Her parents both play in a jazz band. 
  
 Outside of the band, she often hangs out with Ui and Jun whenever the other girls are busy. When the others graduate, she becomes the new Light Music Club president alongside Ui and Jun, who decide to join her. Together with two new members, Sumire and Nao, they form a new band called Wakaba Girls. During the Wakaba Girls' first summer training camp Azusa reveals to Sawako her belief that she is unable to act like a proper president for the Light Music Club; however, Sawako suggests that there is no proper way to define what it means to be a president and that Azusa will do just fine. While on that same training camp Azusa is convinced by the others to become the band's vocalist despite her prior reservations on the issue, and eventually overcomes her weakness to sing in the school festival. 
  
 Her preference in clothing includes pants over skirts. Short pants are among the things she likes to wear. Her room is very tidy and not excessively cute.

332,"Kuchiki, Byakuya(朽木 白哉)",BleachBleach: The Sealed Sword FrenzyBleach Movie 1: Memories of Nobody,6814,https://myanimelist.net/character/907/Byakuya_Kuchiki,"Occupation: Shinigami Captain of the 6th Division 
 Birthday: January 31 (Aquarius) 
 Height: 180 cm (5' 11"") 
 Weight: 64 kg (141 lbs) 
 Zanpakutou: Senbonzakura 
 Title: 28th Head of the Kuchiki Clan 
 Known Relatives: Hisana Kuchiki (wife), Rukia Kuchiki (sister), Ginrei Kuchiki (grandfather), Sojun Kuchiki (father) 
 Likes: Chinese bellflowers, night time walks, spicy food 
 Theme Song: ""Je Chante Pour Passer le Temps"" by Giovanni Mirabassi 
  
 Byakuya Kuchiki is the captain of the 6th Division in the Gotei 13. His lieutenant is Renji Abarai. He is the 28th head of the noble Kuchiki clan, one of the four noble families in Soul Society. As such, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner: he is always quiet and apathetic towards other people. 
  
 He claims that life in general isn't supposed to be entertaining, and in one of the omake chapters, he even makes up an idea for a game that isn't meant to be amusing. In spite of his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him. 
  
 Byakuya is popular among the female shinigami of Soul Society, and was voted number one in the ""captain we desire to release a photo book for"" poll taken by the Shinigami Women's Association. 
  
 Byakuya wears the standard captain uniform along with a white headpiece called a kenseikan (symbolizing his noble rank as the head of the Kuchiki family) and a white scarf made by the master weaver, Tsujishirō Kuroemon III. The scarf is made from silver-white windflower light silk (ginpaku kazahana no uzuginu) and is a family heirloom handed down through the generations to the head of the Kuchiki family. 
  
 Little is known about Byakuya's early history, except that he often played tag with Yoruichi Shihouin using flash steps, though he never was able to beat her, a score that upholds to the current time of the series. 
  
 Byakuya married Hisana, who was then a commoner; therefore, he broke the rules by accepting her into the noble Kuchiki family. Shortly before her death, Hisana asked Byakuya to find and adopt her biological sister, Rukia, whom she had abandoned as a baby. She also made him promise that he would not tell Rukia about her real family, for she believed that by abandoning Rukia when she was younger she was not worthy to be called her sister. 
  
 One year later, Rukia entered the shinigami academy; shortly after, Byakuya found her and immediately adopted her into the Kuchiki clan. By adopting her Byakuya respected his wife's last wish, but had broken the rules of his clan again. He later swore upon his parents' graves that he would never break the rules again, no matter what. As a result, he, though entirely apathetic on the surface, is actually deeply conflicted with the matter of Rukia's execution: should he intervene, it would require breaking the promise to his parents and the rules again, but should he do nothing he would fail to fulfill the promise he made to Hisana to protect Rukia as his own sister. 
  
 While it is not clear, it is implied that Byakuya Kuchiki became captain of the 6th division less than 50 years before the main Bleach storyline (shortly before Rukia had entered the Gotei 13). Gin Ichimaru became captain of the 3rd Division at the same time. 
  
 Byakuya Kuchiki's zanpakutou is Senbonzakura (千本桜, A Thousand Cherry Blossoms). Its shikai is triggered by the command ""scatter"" (散れ, chire). In its shikai, Senbonzakura's blade scatters into a thousand tiny blades. While the blades are supposedly too small to see normally, they appear as cherry blossoms because of the way the light shines on them. Byakuya can control the blades at will, allowing him to shred opponents at a distance and break through almost any defense. While Byakuya can control the blades with his mind alone, using his hands allows him to do so more effectively, making the blades move almost twice as fast. 
  
 Byakuya's bankai, named Senbonzakura Kageyoshi (Vibrant Display of the Thousand Cherry Blossoms), is essentially a much larger version of Senbonzakura's shikai. To activate it, Byakuya drops his sword. The sword passes through the ground and two rows of giant blades rise up from the ground behind Byakuya. These then scatter into a million tiny blades. The number of blades is great enough that Byakuya can use them for defense as well as offense. 
  
 Byakuya's bankai has two extra forms, achieved by arranging the blades in different patterns. They are activated by saying the name of the technique followed by the name of his bankai. The first is ""scene of a massacre"" (senkei, Viz: ""annihilate""), which unites the scattered petals into complete swords that form four rows around Byakuya and his opponent. While Byakuya can control these swords as he does his regular blades, he usually attacks with just one in hand. After immobilizing an opponent, he can call in the other blades to hit them while they're trapped. He can also use all the blades at once for one immensely powerful strike. The second form is ""final scene"" (shuukei, Viz: ""last sight""), which condenses every tiny blade into a single sword to drastically increase its cutting power. The blade appears bright white, earning it the name ""white imperial sword"" (白帝剣, hakuteiken, Viz: ""white emperor sword""). Byakuya also grows pure white wings and a halo-like circle in the back, both made of spiritual power. In the anime, dragon-like beings sprout out of Senbonzakura to create the wings. It is unknown whether these wings are merely a cosmetic effect or if they can be used to fly.

 Ruri Gokou—perhaps better known as her alter-ego Kuroneko (“Black Cat”)—is a member of the All Together, Otaku Girls online community that Saori manages. She goes to an offline meet-up where she meets both Saori and Kirino in person. Like Kirino, she remains aloof during this meeting, and it isn't until after the meeting at Saori's post-gathering that she is formally introduced. Kuroneko is a fan of teenage fantasy anime and is sickened by cute anime, like Meruru. Naturally, this precipitates several arguments between Kirino and her, but they still manage to maintain a friendship despite their differences. Kuroneko is shown to care greatly for her friends despite her cold attitude towards people of “the mortal world.” 
  
 Kuroneko is known for her dark clothing and scarlet eyes. She cosplays daily in gothic lolita clothing similar to those worn on her favorite anime, Maschera ~Lamentation of the Fallen~. However, it is revealed that scarlet isn't her real eye color; she just wears contacts (her real irises are lavender). She writes doujinshi and novels, but none of her works are popular. Kuroneko is very intelligent and has a large vocabulary, making her works too sophisticated for the average reader.",15-16,,,"160cm (the original initial setting), 155cm (animation)",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/101412.jpg

 Gender: male 
 Height: 186 cm 
 Weight: 80 kg 
 Affiliation: The Espada 
 Rank: #6 
  
 Date of birth: July 31st 
 Zodiac sign: Leo 
 Hole location: Abdomen (腹部) 
  
 Grimmjow has light blue hair, and his eyes have blue/green lines below them that are similar to the red marks on Ikkaku Madarame's eyes. Grimmjow's attire consists of a white hakama and a black sash, his white jacket is ragged and consists of an upturned collar, with black inner lining, the sleeves are rolled and Grimmjow wears it open; chest revealed. The remains of his jawbone like hollow mask are relegated to his right cheek, and his hollow hole has moved to his abdomen. 
  
 Grimmjow appears to be a laid back and irreverent individual, but this scruffy appearance hides an impulsive, excessively violent personality and a lethally short temper. Grimmjow is blunt, rude, and quite sadistic, revealing an insane grin in battle, much like Kenpachi Zaraki. Grimmjow has little respect for authority and says whatever is on his mind, regardless of whether or not it is appropriate. This attitude leads to conflicts with Kaname Tōsen, who holds Grimmjow in the same low regard as he did Zaraki. He also has conflicts with Ulquiorra Schiffer, the 4th Espada, usually because Ulquiorra interrupts his fights or doesn't act on his own impulses. He has also developed a grudge against Ichigo Kurosaki for wounding him during their second fight, and is eager to return the favor. He purposefully kept the large scar on his chest from their first battle as a reminder of this. 
  
 Grimmjow is the sixth Espada in Sōsuke Aizen's army of arrancar, meaning he is ranked sixth in terms of strength. Grimmjow was the first character to be revealed as an Espada in the series. A crooked number 6 is tattooed on his back just above and to the right of his hollow hole. Aizen personally marks the Espada, the ten most powerful of his arrancar, with such tattoos as visible marks of their rank and ability. After Kaname Tōsen cuts off and burns his arm, Grimmjow is demoted and quickly replaced by Luppi, much to his annoyance. After Orihime Inoue heals his arm, he kills Luppi to regain his rank, impaling him on his newly restored arm and then vaporizing Luppi's torso with a cero blast. 
  
 When his zanpakutō, Pantera (豹王（パンテラ, Spanish for ""panther,"" Japanese for ""panther king"") is released he regains some of his former feline characteristics such as jagged teeth, feline ears, clawed hands and feet, and a tail that can be used as a powerful whip.This state augments his speed drastically and gives him animal-like agility and movements to match. His roar can create shockwaves in the air, he can also fire a number of largely destructive ""darts"" from his elbows and create energy claws called Desgarrón (豹王の爪（デスガロン, Spanish for ""laceration,"" Japanese for ""panther king's claw"") from his fingertips. 
  
 Grimmjow's character design draws heavily from a character in Tite Kubo's earlier manga, Zombie Powder. The main character of the series, Gamma Akutabi, shares both the bone-like jaw structure and lost arm with Grimmjow, although Gamma wears mechanical prosthetics to cover his disfigurements. Grimmjow's released form makes the resemblance even more apparent. The two have also been identically posed for volume covers.

 Sign: Cancer 
 Height: 157cm 
 Weight: 53kg 
 Blood type: O 
 Age: 16-18 
  
 Favorite Music: Classical music. 
 Experience with playing musical instruments: Started playing piano at age four. Picked up keyboard upon joining the Light Music Club. 
 Family structure: Family of three, both parents. Father is a president of a company. There is a butler at the house. She is being treasured as the only daughter. 
 Dwelling: Single-family home, a rather stately mansion. 
 Commute to school: By train (she lives two train stops away from the school). Because being driven to and from school by car is embarrassing for her, she avoids it. 
 Preferences in clothing: Skirts over pants. High society lady styles, such as elegant one piece dresses. 
 Her room: Canopy bed, antique furniture and such, as expected of a rich girl's room. The room is decorated mostly according to her parents' tastes. 
 Favorite food: She prefers traditional sweets such as daifuku (rice cakes with red bean jam filling) because she worries about calories and because western sweets are brought to her house all the time and she is tired of them. 
 Subjects she is good at: If anything, humanities, though she is also above average at science and math. While she is a little weaker than Mio when it comes to math, her math skills are certainly above her grade level. 
 Subjects she is bad at: No subject in particular. 
 Physical activity: Tsumugi is gentle and quiet and as result she is not good at ball games and track-and-field athletics. However, she has a lot of arm strength and amazing hand grip. She is a very strong girl. 
 Way to pass the time when alone: Elegant teatime 
 Weaknesses and dislikes: She is a little worried about her predisposition to gain weight easily. 
  
 Tsumugi, often referred to as 'Mugi' by her friends, is a wealthy girl with a gentle and sweet personality who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard, though she is also seen playing a Korg RK-100 keytar in the closing credits of the first season. She originally intended to join the choir club, but joins the light music club instead after receiving an invitation and encouragement from both Mio and Ritsu.Tsumugi is considered a piano prodigy since she has been playing the piano since she was four and has experience in winning various piano contests. Mugi has long, pale blonde hair, blue eyes, unusually large eyebrows, which apparently run in her family and a fair complexion that the other characters do not have, but she does not get sunburned. She is the daughter of a company president, and her family has several villas in various places around Japan (and even one in Finland). Since her father also owns a maid café, she often brings confectionery and an assortment of sweets and pastries to the club room, and she diligently makes tea with a tea set which is kept in their club room. Despite her wealth, she is fascinated by and finds joy in ""normal"" activities, such as ordering fast food, sharing french fries with her club mates, holding down part-time jobs and haggling over prices. Tsumugi displays a rebellious streak occasionally, diverting from her normally well-behaved and mature demeanor to the surprise of the others. She also displays a childlike eagerness from time to time, and possesses unusually high strength, being able to effortlessly carry around her own keyboard, Ritsu's drums, amplifiers, and at one point beating an arm-wrestling game in an arcade. 
  
 Tsumugi is often entranced by the sight of two girls interacting closely together, sometimes imagining something more risqué in her head. The series sometimes indicates that Mugi has a crush on their teacher, Sawako Yamanaka. While a lot of things do not bother her, she is fairly conscious about her weight (just like Mio), and she gets a bit anxious when her family's staff start spoiling her friends during villa visits. She later begins learning how to play the guitar from Azusa. Tsumugi has a childhood friend several years younger than her named Sumire Saitō who is a daughter of the family that serves the Kotobuki household. Tsumugi grew up home schooled, and therefore spent very little time in the outside world. Because of their close friendship Sumire would purchase everyday items like manga for Tsumugi that she was not normally allowed to see. Tsumugi was rather taken by some of the yuri manga she received which may have influenced her later perceptions about relationships. When Sumire started high school, Tsumugi wanted her to experience the light music club on her own, but due to Sumire's shyness Tsumugi came up with the excuse to send her to the club room to pick up the tea sets that had been left there and told Sawako when Sumire did join that it was okay to leave the tea sets there.

 Height: 150 cm (4'11"") 
  
 A middle schooler in class 1-2, she sits in the back of the classroom next to Nishikata. Academically talented and physically capable, she claims her only weaknesses are her ticklish armpits and her inability to stop teasing Nishikata. 
  
 From when she first met him, during the first class of the day of the school's entrance ceremony, she has spent much of their time together pranking him, teasing him, and challenging him to unwinnable games. 
  
 She seems entirely in control of her emotions in every situation she is in, contrasting starkly with Nishikata. Beyond her academic and teasing talents, she has the uncanny ability to guess exactly what Nishikata is thinking, so long as she doesn't try to embarrass him by suggesting that he was dreaming up something dirty, or by making a silly face which inspires instant laughter in everyone who has seen it.

 Car: High tech two-tone Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86) 
 Likes: green seasons, rear end of his AE86, naps 
 Dislikes: showoffs, losing, girls that flirt 
  
 Takumi Fujiwara is the son of Bunta Fujiwara, the owner of a tofu shop in his hometown Akina. He rarely shows emotion. His best friend is Itsuki Takeuchi, who is a racing fan. 
  
 Takumi works part-time at a gas station with Itsuki, along with Iketani, who is a member of the local racing team, the Akina Speed Stars. In the first few episodes both Itsuki and Iketani think that Takumi has no driving ability because of Takumi's total disinterest in cars and racing. 
  
 The only one who suspects that Takumi has an advanced driving technique is the owner of the gas station, Yuuichi, as seen in the episode where Takumi discusses drifting technique with Iketani and Itsuki. In fact, Takumi has far more experience on the touge than Iketani and Itsuki, as Takumi has been driving his father's AE86 Trueno for five years (since he was 13 in his first year of junior high school, 7th grade), delivering tofu to a hotel at 4 a.m. every day. Takumi has been manipulated subtly by Bunta into developing driving skills, without being fully aware of Bunta's intent. 
  
 Bunta aside, Takumi's driving technique is the best on Akina; the very fact that he has managed to win races against far more powerful cars with his AE86 Trueno is testament to his driving skills. As a result of constant everyday practice and over 5 years of experience on Akina, Takumi is able to adapt to nearly any situation that presents itself during a race with astonishing speed. One factor in his nearly unparalleled driving skills is his ability to visualize the road in his head, thus making up for the lack of visibility no matter how dark the mountain pass may be. He is an instinctive rather than an intellectual driver. Although the mizutoshi technique is a great but difficult technique that his father taught him, it lead him to many victories through out the story.","18, 19 (Project D)",,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/296425.jpg

 Hobbies: collecting cute things, obsessing over cute things, treasure hunting 
 Famous quote: ""Friends. Those companions you speak of are only friends during those fun, yet unimportant times. When painful times come, they won't be your ally."" 
  
 Rena is the main female protagonist of the question arcs and a girl who returned from Ibaraki to Hinamizawa one year ago, she is in the same grade level as Keiichi. 
  
 She is very kind and takes care of Keiichi whenever possible, but is also naïve and is usually subject to light teasing by Keiichi, it is hinted later in the series that she loves him. She is distinguished by her obsession with things she perceives as adorable calling them kaaii (かぁいい, a slurred form of kawaii (かわいい), meaning ""cute""), which are usually moekko characters or items she finds while scouring the local dump. Generally, these things are not considered cute by others. 
  
 She also utters the phrase hau (はぅ) when excited or flustered, and has a habit of repeating phrases at the ends of her sentences, most famously ""kana? kana??"" (かな? かな??, lit. ""I wonder, I wonder?""). 
  
 Every now and then, she goes treasure hunting in the town's trash heap, searching for ""cute"" things to collect, and whenever she sees something that grabs her attention, she proclaims, ""I wanna take it home!"" (お持ち帰り, Omochikaerī) and proceeds to try and do so, becoming virtually unstoppable during these intervals. 
  
 When in ""Take it Home"" mode, she comically becomes stronger and faster. Despite this disarming trait, Rena is shown to be amazingly observant and perceptive about the things around her (in Watanagashi-hen, she was able to deduce that both Rika and Satoko went to the Sonozaki house by looking through the contents of their fridge and a flier). 
  
 According to Mion, while Rena might seem cute herself, people should be careful not to anger her as she becomes quite scary when angered.",13,July 28,,"161 cm (5'3"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/264395.jpg

She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk. 
  
 Ed could be considered a ""free spirit""; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor. 
  
 Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe. 
  
 In the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person. 
  
 Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap Lütfen (he calls Ed ""Françoise"", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means ""excuse me, check please"" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as ""Tomato"" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net. 
  
 Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head. 
  
 Ed has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also).

 The series' main protagonist, Ryuuji is a seventeen-year-old high school student in his second year, class 2-C. Due to biological inheritance, his sanpaku eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent and causes many misunderstandings. He lives in a fatherless family with just his mother, and due to this, Ryuuji has learned to be self-sufficient. He is good at cooking and keeps everything in his house clean (to the point of obsession), and also excels at sewing. He holds a crush on Minori Kushieda, a girl in his class. He has a pet, parakeet named ""Inko-chan"" (""inko"" literally means ""parakeet"" in Japanese). Ryuuji often helps Taiga with domestic chores which she is unable to perform. At school, he is known as ""the only person able to stop the palmtop tiger,"" referring to Taiga's nickname. Due to the misunderstandings of his look, he tends to look down on himself and lacks self-confidence. Despite this, he is rather calm in most situations. He is responsible, smart and has great grades, even when compared to Yuusaku Kitamura, his best friend. He is dense when it comes to girls' feelings, especially about things between him, Taiga, Minori and Ami. His feelings and relationship to Taiga begin to change as he spends more time with her throughout the series.

 Count Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire. 
  
 He was born Reinhard von Müsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived. 
  
 The emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again. 
  
 To achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the ""count of Lohengramm."" As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Brünhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on. 
  
 Nicknamed ""Blonde Brat"" by his enemies and ""Golden Lion"" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart.

Vongola Shiki Shuugakuryokou, Kuru!!Katekyou Hitman Reborn! x ēlDLIVE Special",5905,https://myanimelist.net/character/670/Tsunayoshi_Sawada,"Tsuna is set to become the tenth generation boss of the Vongola family. 
  
 In school, Tsuna has been given the harsh nickname of ""No Good Tsuna,"" as he is very clumsy, gets low marks in school and is somewhat of a pushover. 
  
 Although he is the tenth generation Vongola boss, Tsuna is unwilling to take part in anything that has to do with the Mafia. He always denies the fact that he is a future Mafia boss and tries to avoid anyone involved with the Mafia. In the Future arc he states that he would rather destroy the Vongola family than accept its bloody history. Tsuna is often surprised and horrified (for a comedic effect) at Reborn's and other mafiosos' actions. Later, even though he still wants nothing to do with the Mafia, he is grateful for the friends he has made since meeting Reborn. He cares a lot for his new ""family"" and would put himself in the way of danger in order to protect them. 
  
 There have been many parallels that link Tsuna with the first boss and founder of the Vongola family, Giotto. Both of their personalities are likely to be very similar as it has been shown that they have similar goals and ways of standards.

 Kenji Harima is the male protagonist, an ex-delinquent who loves Tenma. Although he does not practice any specific martial arts style, few people are able to match him in hand-to-hand combat. He has the ability to communicate with animals, and possesses a wide variety of strange and exotic pets which he named after European monarchs. He has a little brother, Shuuji, who likes Yakumo. 
  
 Harima struggles often to confess to Tenma, though he knows she has absolutely no feelings for him and may even dislike him. Every time Harima finds the courage to tell Tenma his true feelings, something happens which prevents him from succeeding. Harima also must deal with situations involving his classmate Eri, unaware of the fact that she does not know whether to like or dislike him. He gets extremely jealous seeing Karasuma and Tenma together, but his attempts to put a stop to that usually end up bringing them closer. Ironically, Harima admires Nijō jō(二条丈) the mangaka, which is Karasuma's pen name. To date, Tenma has yet to hear his confession properly. He also works as a mangaka, having Yakumo as his assistant, creating another source of misunderstandings, as it took a long time for Tenma to realize that their relationship is only professional, at least by Harima's side.",,,,"180 cm (5'11"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/29703.jpg

 He is a successful gambler and a pitcher in the gambling game based on baseball called “One Outs”. After losing a game of One Outs for the first time to the Lycaons' cleanup batter (Hiromichi Kojima), he joins the Lycaons team with an odd contract – the “One Outs Contract” – that decides Toua's pay based on his performance. 
  
 Arguably, the most fearsome trait of Tokuchi is his perceptive intellect, which he uses to manipulate professional baseball. As a baseball pitcher, he psychologically manipulates and intimidates the batters he faces along with playing high-stakes psychological and intellectual battles against his own antagonistic team owner, competing team coaches, and underhanded opposing teams. As the Lycaons' famed star pitcher, he can pitch entire games without giving up a single hit. 
  
 Tokuchi's most important skill is probably his ability to “seemingly read minds”. Tokuchi is able to observe his opponent and throwing the according pitch, that will completely defy all his batters expectations, making almost impossible to hit Tokuchi's ball.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/90985.jpg

 Height: 190 cm (6'3"") 
 Hair: Black 
 Eyes: Purple (Manga), Brown (Anime) 
 Grade: Special Grade 
 Favorite food: Zaru soba served on a woven bamboo tray. 
  
 Suguru is a tall, slim, and muscular man with long black hair partially tied up in a bun while the rest drapes down his back. He has thin black eyes and bangs that occasionally cover the left eye. His earlobes are large enough to fit fairly large circular earrings. In 2006, Suguru's hair was much shorter as a student, most of it tied up but his bangs were still as prominent. After August 2007 when Suguru became a curse user, his hair began to grow longer and reflect the length it is in 2017.  As a student, Suguru wore a normal jujutsu high uniform. While masquerading himself under the facade of a Buddhist priest, Suguru dons the appropriate attire. He sports a gold-colored kāṣāya garment over black yukata robes. His monk attire is completed with white tabi socks and zōri sandals. 
  
 Suguru Geto hated non-sorcerers, usually referring to them as ""monkeys."" He felt sorcerers are the superior race and humanity's next stage of evolution. He was smug and extremely condescending towards normal humans, using fake personas to lure in vulnerable people who were cursed. Suguru found non-sorcerers disgusting enough to spray himself in order to disinfect the ""monkey stench."" He believed monkeys only have two roles in association with him, money-collecting monkeys and curse-collecting monkeys. If they weren't fulfilling their roles, Suguru would gladly allow curses to kill them without any remorse.",27,,,"190 cm (6'3"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/524519.jpg

He values his friends heavily throughout the story. He shows kindness and a willingness to self-sacrifice for the sake of his friends, even going so far as to brand himself the traitor in order to prevent further discord. 
  
 As the story progresses and the games become more and more serious, however, Yuuichi begins to show a much more sinister side. This dark nature is likely the result of his troubled upbringing by an adopted mother who had to sell her body and a con man/swindler who served as a father figure and teacher. He shows little remorse for any of his more devious actions and appears sadistic at points when he takes pleasure in the misfortunes of his enemies.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/466241.jpg

Being a ""cool"" guy, he almost always uses the direct approach which most of the time fails. He sometimes becomes too driven by the idea of eating souls, which leads him to bicker with Maka, but in the end they remain friends and partners. 
  
 His way of absorbing souls is by literally eating them. He says that it's the texture, not the taste, that matters. When Dr. Stein saw his soul, he said it was that of ""a twisted person with a sarcastic soul.""

 The main character of the series, called Serena in the English dub (nicknamed Bunny in the manga). Usagi is a carefree schoolgirl with an enormous capacity for love, and transforms into the heroine called Sailor Moon. At the beginning of the series she is portrayed as an immature crybaby who hates having to fight, however over the course of the series you come to know her sweet and selfless side.  Usagi is a bit selfish, very lazy, clumsy, and also an academic underachiever. She's also not very good at cooking. However, she cares deeply about her friends and family. 
  
 Usagi is very trusting, and believes that everyone has a better nature. She doesn't believe in killing innocent people, even when they had been transformed into vicious monsters, and always seeks ways to help them instead. Usagi matures a great deal through the series, and even though she is still prone to some childish behavior and bouts of silliness, she becomes a capable young woman.

 Height: 156 cm (5'1"") 
 Affiliation: U.A. 
 Quirk: Zero Gravity 
  
 Ochako is Izuku's best friend. Her Quirk is Zero Gravity which allows her to make any object she touches with her fingertips float, although she will become nauseous if she uses the ability too much. Aside from Katsuki, she also refers to Izuku as ""Deku"" but unlike the former, she calls him this nickname out of affection, commenting that ""Deku"" gives the vibe of never giving up. She eventually switches to Deku-kun a move that prompted him to accept the name. She comes from a family of construction workers, and because there is not much of a market for them, they are poor. Due to this, Ochako aspires to become a hero for money so she can give her parents an easy life. Ochako originally meets Izuku prior to Yuuei's entrance exam, after she stops him from falling over after he tripped on his own foot. This caused Izuku to develop a large crush on her (as he had ""talked"" to a girl), to the point of blushing and stammering every time he is with her. Izuku eventually returns the favor by saving her during the entrance exam, and Yuuga later deduces that Ochako returns Izuku's feelings, despite her attempts to deny this.

 Being the vice captain, he has a soothing personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's official setter anymore, he doesn't dream of giving up on playing in general. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates not to give up, no matter how rough the situation might be. 
  
 Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara replied that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future. 
  
 He is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym (back during the first years's 3-on-3 match) even though he always comes in late, so Sugawara knew that something was up. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during the game. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying ""bring it"" and ""send it to me"" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo.

Chifuyu's confidants pointed him to Baji, who was also a famous thug, after which Chifuyu wanted to meet him. When Chifuyu meets Baji in his classroom, he is dressed as a nerd who tries very hard to learn the school material. This is because Baji's grades are quite bad and from now on he doesn't want to worry his mother with his bad grades, but wants to write good grades. When Chifuyu enters the room, Baji is just despairing of reading a word in a book, whereupon Chifuyu points out to him how to read it correctly. They start talking to each other instead of Chifuyu challenging Baji to a fight. The two become friends and later, while Chifuyu is on his way home being attacked by thugs he has angered, Baji steps in to help him. From then on, they are an inseparable duo, which also results in Chifuyu becoming Baji's vice commander. Chifuyu admires Baji extremely and is not angry when he beats him up and asks Takemichi if Baji is not the coolest of them all. Chifuyu also seems to enjoy reading shoujo manga.","14 (past), 26 (future)","December 19, 1991",,168 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/387987.jpg

 Sakura is the only female ninja of Team 7. When she first meets Naruto she is physically weak and has an immense crush on Sasuke. She dislikes Naruto as well.The only thing she's good at is her brain as the smartest girl in ninja academy her excellent chakra control, out of that she could be categorized as a kunoichi. In the first part of the Chuunin exam she is easily able to answer the questions, but in the second part she is unable to defeat the Sound ninja attacking Sasuke and Naruto. She makes a pledge to become a better ninja and a better person. To prove her commitment she cuts her long hair with a kunai. 
  
 In the third part of the Chuunin Exam she goes up against Ino Yamanaka, her former friend but current rival for Sasuke's affections. The two defeat each other simultaneously. This turns their relationship in a rivalry between friends. 
  
 After the time skip she is now a chuunin having been trained by Tsunade for the past two years. She is now a medic Ninja of considerable skill, enough skill to possibly defeat Tsunade one day. It is shown when she is able to do a complicated surgery to extract poisons out of Kankuro body and make an antidote of the new type poison that Sasori used,which the Suna gakure medical-nin unable to do. 
  
 During the time skip she's also matured in personality, she become calmer compare when she were Genin, but she still has her temper especially when Naruto is fooling around in front of her she will beat him up into a bloody pulp. 
  
 Sakura has grown not only as a medical-nin, now she's also a capable fighter.

Additionally she is a genjutsu type, and though she has yet to use that potential she does show an almost complete immunity to being trapped in an illusion.

Ritsu is cheerful, often likes making jokes and is sarcastic most of the time. She is skilled at brainstorming ideas that earn money for the club. Ritsu has shoulder-length, brown hair, with her bangs pulled back with a yellow hairband, and gold-colored eyes. She wears her school jacket open. She says she chose to play the drums because they are ""cool,"" but she then admits that she has trouble playing instruments which involve intricate finger movements, such as the bass, guitar and keyboard. 
  
 She is a childhood friend of Mio and will often take the opportunity to tease her whenever Mio is cowering from something. She is also known to become easily jealous of Mio's other high school friends, even going as far as spying on Mio when on outings with them. Ritsu is always on the go and will stop at nothing for the success of the light music club. Despite her rough mannerisms and speech, she gets cast as Juliet by the majority of her classmates in their class play rendition of Romeo and Juliet and, in the end, manages to act like a proper girl. In the anime, she states her favorite drummer is Keith Moon of The Who. She is skilled at cooking. She has a younger brother named Satoshi.

 The main female character of the story. Victorique has the appearance of a small, almost doll-like, girl with long golden hair and emerald eyes and a voice that sounds exactly like that of an older woman. It is mentioned once that she is 15 years old. Another important part of Victorique's appearance is a pipe that she smokes when thinking about something. She spends her days at the conservatory at the top of the library, reading several difficult books, often in different languages, simultaneously. She points at one wall of the library and has told Kazuya that she has read almost all the books over there.

 Height: 177 cm (5'10"") 
 Weight: 68 kg (150 lbs) 
 Swimming specialty: Butterfly 
  
 The rival swimmer from Samezuka Academy. 
  
 Rin Matsuoka is Haruka's rival who is also in 11th grade. He had gone abroad to study swimming, but his personality changed immensely by the time he had returned to Japan and for this reason he often perplexes his former teammates. 
  
 Rin goes to all-boys boarding school. 
  
 While he may not look like a loving brother, he cares for Gou, and is very protective of his sister. 
  
 In the drama CD, he asked Captain Mikoshiba not to call Gou by her first name, declaring that he'll never give him permission to do so. Despite not being present when Captain  Mikoshiba asked Gou out on a date (in which Gou turned him down), he felt like punching Mikoshiba after he has done so, and was wondering why he suddenly felt like that. 
  
 He is strongly opposed to the idea of Gou dating any males, getting extremely worried and uncharacteristically worked up when he thought that Gou was on a date with a guy every week (or preparing a present for a guy), and he ended up stalking her on one of her 'dates' (although only after promptings from Nitori). Even though it turned out that Gou was buying Rin a present with the help of one of her friends.",,,,"177 cm (5'10"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/265841.jpg

He carries around a large wooden box filled with medicine and holy tools. Among them is an enchanted sword that is used to slay the mononoke. To use the sword, the Medicine Seller must find the ""Katachi"" (shape), ""Makoto"" (truth), and ""Kotowari"" (reasoning) of the mononoke he wishes to exorcise. Once the sword has been unsheathed, he transforms into a demonic-like creature. While his origins are unknown, it is clear that the Medicine Seller is not human or at least not entirely human; he has elf-like ears, and pointy canine teeth. Even in the time-skip Bakeneko arc, the Medicine Seller still appears as the same handsome youth from the previous arcs (the only differences in his appearance from previous arcs is he now wears small round red stud earrings and a ring on his index finger). It was revealed in the Umibozu episode when the ayakashi asked the passenger's fears, the Medicine Seller calmly answers he is afraid that there is no form, truth, or reason at the edge of the world, thus no longer having a reason to exist.

That aside, Yuuko has served as a major catalyst for Watanuki's transformation, acting somewhat as his mentor. She loves to drink and eat Watanuki's wonderful cooking and dragging Watanuki on crazy outings at the drop of a hat. 
  
 Despite this immature and free-spirited attitude, Yuuko has been known to be sage-like and serious when the time calls for it. Yuuko seems to know the true hitsuzen that Watanuki will follow, and has often offered cryptic messages to warn him of impending danger or a folk tale that he should take a bit more seriously. She also seems to truly care about him, making sure he is safe at night, sending the Kudakitsune (pipe-fox) with him for extra protection, or calling Doumeki when he needs saving. 
  
 Yuuko is very powerful when it comes to magic and knowledge and is highly respected within the spirit realm. However, she doesn't often appear to get directly involved in things beyond whatever contract she has with those making wishes. Sometimes, she sends Watanuki to do jobs for her, such as when she granted a wish from Himawari. Yuuko seems to take the role of someone playing chess when it comes to the big picture of things that are going on. 
  
 In Horitsuba Gakuen, she is a ruthless principal, who always climbs into rooms through the window.

 Height: 174 cm 
 Weight: 66 kg 
 Blood type: A 
 Distinguishing features: X-shaped scar on left cheek 
 Rank: Sergeant 
 Codename: Urzu 7 
 Hobbies: Fishing, Reading 
 Weak subjects: Kobun, Japanese history 
  
 Sousuke is an approximately 17 year old sergeant within the paramilitary counter-terrorist force, Mithril. He is a member of the SRT (Special Response Team) of the Western Pacific Battle Group ""Tuatha de Danaan"". His call sign is Urzu-7 and his ID number is B-3128, and operates as team point-man as an Arm Slave specialist. 
  
 In addition to being a capable Arm Slave pilot, Sousuke is a specialist in Arm Slave operations and maintenance, improvised explosives, small arms, survival training, anti-armor combat, trap setting and camouflage. Additionally, he is proficient in logistics, demolitions, breach and forced entry, covert intrusion, and hand to hand combat. His background and experience as a guerrilla fighter, and later a mercenary soldier has made him much more sensitive and knowledgeable about tactics and methods more commonly used by guerrillas than government trained regulars. 
  
 Sousuke is unfortunately not very good at social interaction off the battlefield. He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available ""civil"" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series' humor. 
  
 His previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. 
  
 It is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan. While in Helmajistan he had a close friend named Zayid.

413,"Koiwai, Yotsuba(小岩井 四葉)",,5259,https://myanimelist.net/character/3568/Yotsuba_Koiwai,"Yotsuba is drawn as a small girl with green hair done in four pigtails, giving her somewhat the appearance of her namesake, a four-leaf clover. She has a carefree and energetic personality, taking delight in simple matters even as she learns about all manner of things in her daily life. In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, ""She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down."" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye. 
  
 At the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as ""Yotsubox"" as a portmanteau of ""Yotsuba's Box"", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her. Yotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer. 
  
 The series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island ""to the left."" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old. 
  
 Yotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework.

414,Hiei(飛影),Yuu☆Yuu☆HakushoYuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho (Movie)Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho: Meikai Shitou-hen - Honoo no Kizuna,5248,https://myanimelist.net/character/732/Hiei,"Hiei is one of the shortest characters, at only 4 feet 10 inches, not including his hair. 
  
 He wears a white headband that conceals his Jagan Eye, which is placed on his forehead and has a purple iris. His eyes are reddish in tint, very large and slightly slanted, giving him in the beginning of the series a very sinister look. He normally wears a black cloak-like jacket and pants, with a black (and on occasion blue) undershirt. His hair is black with a blue tint, and usually spiked with white highlights on the front. Hiei wields a sword, which he can use both as a combat weapon and as a way to safely channel the dark flames from the underworld which he rarely uses as he finds it ""barbaric"". On top of a very well-muscled frame he has high speed, accuracy and precision. 
  
 Hiei is a male fire demon born to a race of female ice demons. His mother, Hina, is forced to abandon him because koorime prohibit male children. Hiei is taken in by a group of thieves, and he learns to kill at a very young age. Throughout his childhood, his one shred of sanity is a necklace made from his mother's hiruiseki (氷涙石, ice tear stone). He eventually loses the necklace in the heat of battle. In order to find the lost hirui, Hiei acquires the Jagan. He uses the Jagan to seek out the place of his birth and learns that his grief-stricken mother committed suicide; Hiei also learns that he has a twin sister, Yukina, who has disappeared from the village. He now has another goal, to search for Yukina. Hiei is aloof, elusive, and misanthropic, often belittling and mocking humans and their emotions. 
  
 Although relatively taciturn, he occasionally squabbles with and insults his teammates, especially Kuwabara but deep down he holds a certain amount of respect for him and vice versa. In fact, Hiei respects all his teammates, but seems to be closest to Kurama and Yusuke. Hiei prefers to work on his own agenda, and has a notorious reputation in Demon World as a killer even when he was a D Class demon. Despite this, deep down he is a loner that wants true friendship and companionship. He is very honorable, always keeping his word.

 Age: 6407 
  
 Jibril is the youngest and strongest of the Flügel race. Her love toward knowledge started even before the declaration of the Ten Oaths. She is against the book sharing law created by the Council of Eighteen Wings and left Avant Heim, her homeland, to win the National Library of Elchea from the previous king in a game. When Sora heard what happened to the library, he challenged Jibril in order to gain knowledge of the other kingdoms. When she lost the game, she became Sora and Shiro's servant since she had bet everything she owned, including herself, claiming that knowledge was worth her own life. However, she was allowed to keep the library and maintain it although she now must share it with the rest of Imanity. Jibril thus took the siblings as her masters and over time she began to understand and accept Sora's belief in the potential of humans. 
  
 According to Azriel, Jibril was given the gift of imperfection by Artosh. This gift is what Artosh believed would allow Jibril to find the answer to the Flügels' continued existence should he disappear (which was, in fact, the case).",6407,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/248121.jpg

 Suruga, the main character of Suruga Monkey, is Koyomi's underclassman, star of the school's basketball team and one of Hitagi's acquaintances from back in junior high school. She is so well known in her school that not a single student had not heard of her, mostly because it was her who was responsible of the rapid rise of success of the school's girls basketball team due to her talents. She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball. Although her sexual preference is clearly towards females, she does not have a hard time interacting with males, and she even manages to say teasing remarks when she is comfortable with the person she talks to (i.e. Araragi). She is 160cm tall. 
  
 Suruga is a girl with brown eyes and dark bluish hair. Because of her club activities as a basketball varsity player, she boasts an athletic physique, although she admits that her breasts might not be ample enough for Araragi to notice. 
  
 Her clothing style reflects her boyish personality; when she is not in the uniform of Naoetsu Private High School, she often wears sleeveless clothing and shorts. Whichever clothes she wears, she is regularly seen wearing cycling shorts, which she considers to be her underwear, much to Araragi's shock upon hearing it straight from her (as it implies that she does not wear panties).",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/222449.jpg

 Birthday: May 5 
 Nationality: Japanese 
 Height: 169 cm 
 Weight: 58 kg 
 School: Namimori Junior High 
 Grade: 3rd year 
 Affliation: Disciplinary Committee, The Foundation 
 Vongola Ring: Ring of Cloud 
 Box Animal: Roll (Version Vongola Box) 
  
 Hibari is the leader of the Discipline Committee, or Prefects, who all happen to be a group of delinquents loyal to Hibari. Like his subordinates, he too is a violent delinquent who uses his status to harass other students. However, he prefers to be alone and cares little for his subordinates. If he is amongst a crowd, he tends to play violent ""games"" with rules like ""I'll kill anyone who wakes me up when I'm sleeping,"" and as mentioned, the loser often has to pay the price with his life. 
  
 His catchphrase is ""I'll bite you to death,"" which he says to everyone who he is ready to fight. In one comic scene, Ryohei misunderstands it and imagines Hibari swallowing Gola Moska's head. He also likes saying ""wao,"" and when he fights weak opponents, he tends to taunt them by calling them a ""herbivore."" He likes eating Japanese food and hamburgers. 
  
 Hibari may be a violent and cruel person at times, but he is very proud of his school, and is apparently the only person who likes their school's song, even using it as his ringtone. He has also been shown to have an affinity for birds; he adopts one of the avian followers of Kokuyo assassin Birds' and trained it to chirp his school's song. The bird (subsequently nicknamed ""Hibird"" due to its connection to Hibari) becomes attached to Hibari, so much so that it still remains with Hibari nine years and ten months into the future. 
  
 His attitude and abilities have gained the attention of Reborn, who sees him as a potential candidate for Tsuna's family. However, Hibari likes nothing more than to kill those who are in his way or people that are crowding.

 Belonging to the fierce tribe of the Fanalis, descendants of the red lions originating from ''Alma torran''. She is inspired by Morgiana from the Thousand and One Nights, the intelligent slave who served Alibaba in ''Alibaba and the Forty Thieves''. 
  
 Morgiana was the slave of Jamil, a young man obsessed since childhood with the idea of being king, who controlled her through mistreatment, gaining her loyalty through fear. Due to this mistreatment she became unfriendly, avoiding to show her emotions openly in order not to get into trouble.  But after Goltas, another of Jamil's slaves, made her rethink the idea of no longer being a slave, she opted to leave the dungeon to return to her home of origin, the dark continent, to meet her own. Thanks to this new journey she undertook with her friends, Alibaba and Aladdin, she was able to start being herself, showing her true character and personality little by little.

In addition to her strong leg strength which can even enable her to vertically run up walls, she has a keen sense of smell on par with that of a dog's, can also smell the stench of death emanating from the bottom of the pit and the smell of someone hiding in unseen places. Although weaker than her leg strength, her arm strength is strong enough to send a human like Alibaba flying. 
  
 After Alibaba's departure from Qishan, she put the words of her defector, Goltas, on her chest, and started a journey to her hometown, Katarg. In the middle of her journey towards Balbadd, she helped Leila and Sahsa's caravan to eliminate the thieves at the rock quarry.

 Draken is one of the main characters from Tokyo Revengers. He is one of Mikey's closest confidants and friends, since he is also Toman's vice-captain. Draken often seems to represent the role of the moral part of the duo, since he appears very conscientious. For example, he later tries to persuade Kazutora to reconcile with Mikey and prevent the war between Valhalla and Toman. Draken has tremendous fighting power and is probably Toman's strongest fighter after Mikey. He loves to work on motorcycles and dreams of running his own motorcycle (repair) store later on.  Since Draken doesn't seem to have a family, he lives in Shibuya in a building where women do favors for money. He has a room there and was also more or less raised by the owner, even though this seems quite unusual. He has nothing to do with the business there per se, but simply lives there and also knows all the women who work there personally.",15 (past) 27 (present),"May 10, 1990",,185 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/388001.jpg

 Weight: 42 kg (92.4 lbs) 
  
 Miku is the second Vocaloid2 after Sweet Ann and the first installment in the Vocaloid2 Character Vocal Series by Crypton Future Media released on August 31, 2007. The name of the title and the character of the software was chosen by combining ""hatsu"" (初, first), ""ne"" (音, sound), and miku (未来, future). The data for the voice was created by actually sampling the voice of Saki Fujita, a Japanese voice actress. Unlike general purpose speech synthesizers, the software is tuned to create J-pop songs commonly heard in anime, but it is possible to create songs from other genres. 
  
 Nico Nico Douga played a fundamental role in the recognition and popularity of the software. Soon after the release of the software, users of Nico Nico Douga started posting videos with songs created with the software. According to Crypton, a popular video with a comically altered software mascot holding a leek, singing Ievan Polkka, presented multifarious possibilities of applying the software in multimedia content creation. As the recognition and popularity of the software grew, Nico Nico Douga became a place for collaborate content creation. Popular original songs written by a user would generate illustrations, animation in 2D and 3D, and remixes by other users. Other creators would show their unfinished work and ask for ideas. 
  
 On October 18, 2007, an Internet BBS website reported Hatsune Miku was suspected to be victim of censorship by Google and Yahoo!, since images of Miku did not show up on the image searches. Google and Yahoo denied any censorship on their part, blaming the missing images on a bug that does not only affect ""Hatsune Miku"" but other search keywords as well. Both companies expressed a willingness to fix the problem as soon as possible. Images of Miku were re-listed on Yahoo on October 19. 
  
 A Hatsune Miku manga called ""Maker Hikōshiki Hatsune Mix"" began serialization in the Japanese manga magazine Comic Rush on November 26, 2007, published by Jive. The manga is drawn by Kei, the original character designer for Hatsune Miku. A second manga called Hachune Miku no Nichijō Roipara! drawn by Ontama began serialization in the manga magazine Comp Ace on December 26, 2007, published by Kadokawa Shoten.

 Height: 158 cm

 Family: Mother (Natsuko), Father, Older sister (Nao) and younger sister (Nami). 
  
 Komatsu came to Tokyo, looking to find her dream. Unlike Osaki, Komatsu came from a large and happy household, though her childish outlook prevented her from living on her own initially. She's the middle child of three sisters. 
  
 Her chance encounter with Osaki began a friendship which changes Komatsu's life forever. She is introduced to Osaki's band, Black Stones, and their members. She later even helps ""Blast"" to find their bassist, by drawing a poster to advertise the vacancy. Much to her surprise, she also discovers that the members of Blast were friends with the members of Trapnest, a popular rock band of which she's a very big fan. 
  
 Trivia: Her nickname ""Hachi/Hachiko"" is a play on words for both the Japanese No.8, as well as a reference to the loyal dog ""Hachi,"" who waited 9 years following his owner's death. The nickname fits very well as Nana ""Hachi"" is seen as Nana No.2 (Nana means No.7, depending on the Kanji), and is known to be very depending on others and blindly loyal (at least in the beginning of the series).",,,,158 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/88130.jpg

 Famous quote: ""People cannot change the past. All we can do, is accept our own actions. If you still wish to be burdened by your sins, let it show in your future actions. It is your choice how to perceive something that has already happened."" 
  
 Kotomine Kirei is the overseer of the Holy Grail War and resides at the church on top of the hill. He is callous and sarcastic, but also quite knowledgeable. As the supervisor of the Grail War, it is his duty to uphold the rules of the Holy Grail War, cover up any incidents that might expose the War to the public, and give sanctuary to any Masters who drop out. Both Tohsaka and Shirou appear to detest him, though in truth they don't seem to dislike him too much. Despite the enmity between the Mage's Association and the Church, Kotomine is a member of both organizations, which is presumably the reason he was chosen to be be the overseer. 
  
 Kotomine plays an important role in the unfolding events in all three routes, but the route that features him most heavily is the final one, Heaven's Feel where he takes an active role early on.

 Personality: Zack often speaks in foul language. He will occasionally swear in the situations he's in, and will not hesitate even if it is towards Rachel, despite her young age. It is also revealed that Zack never had any education of sort, as hinted in his inability to read, and when characters in the story explain things to him in long terms that makes Zack frustrated and unable to understand unless if it was explained to him in simplest terms. Because of his lack of knowledge and education, when he is put into a situation which requires using the brain to figure something out, he often forces upon Rachel to do the problem solving. 
  
 Zack has a mental disability, whether it was something he had since he was born or he developed at some point in life is uncertain. This disability consists of him having a lust to destroying things, even to the means of killing. His blood rushes to a certain point and causes him to lose control of his urges. He will go into a short phase of destroying anything in his way until he's satisfied or until he rehabilitates. 
  
 However, it can be regarded that while Zack is not academically intelligent, he is high in instinctive/survival intelligence, where he relies on his instincts to get him through situations, and can be seen as clever. Which could be how he was able to survive as a child, and up until now. And perhaps can even be described as an animal in a way. Zack is also extremely strong and rather fast, being able to run at rather incredible speed rates, and overall is actually a rather powerful character, which balances out the fact he isn't that smart. Zack is also VERY brutally honest, as he hates people who lie with a burning passion, and never ever sugarcoats anything he says. 
  
 As a child, Zack was seemingly much more quiet and reserved. He was shown to never say a word throughout the manga specifically. 
  
 Zack's first murder: He stayed in a run-down orphanage where children were likely to die, and the trafficking was illegal. His caretakers were rather abusive, and always referred to him as a monster, and even forced him to bury the corpse of a dead child simply because they didn't want to deal with the smell. Until one day, one of the caretakers left the TV on, where it showed a horror film that included a serial killer. And Zack just-so-happened to stumble upon it while it was on, becoming fascinated with the murderer specifically in the film. And he took inspiration from it, and he murdered his caretakers by mutilating their bodies, and later buried them in the back. And years later, his recent killings became famous, and is currently a wanted criminal.

 Favourite quote: ""You were there for me, you saved me, much like what today, you asked me out on a date and showed me how nice this world is."" 
  
 Tooka Yatogami is one of the main female characters of the Date A Live series. She is the first Spirit saved by Shidou and transfers into his class at the end of the first volume. Shidou named her for the date of their first meeting, the 10th. Reine later added the Yatogami surname for her. She is ignorant of the ways of the world, but nevertheless has a normal sense of embarrassment. She seems to have strong feelings for Shidou, which she is shown to be unable to understand when she gets jealous after seeing Shidou accidentally kiss Yoshino. 
  
 When Tooka first appeared on Earth, unsealed, she was very wary of everyone before Shido finally got the chance to talk to her, because she was constantly being attacked by the AST. However after she was sealed by Shido, she could finally develop, express, and experience life on Earth. Due to the fact that Tooka is new to everything including her emotions, she has a very child-like personality that can make her seem naïve, emotional, energetic, and sometimes gullible due to the fact that she has not been on Earth that long to interact with other people. 
  
 However, when learning that Yoshino is a Spirit like herself she decides to support Shidou in his cause to save the other Spirits such as Kurumi, even actively participating in battles at times. Due to being a Spirit, she is always being targeted by the AST and is aiming for the kill, because of that she hated humans for always shunning her and thinking that she wasn't allowed to live in this world, but her whole life changed when she met Shidou. 
  
 She was overjoyed that she could live with Shidou now but knowing that Origami was there too she was somehow agitated and is always having a minor quarrel with Origami (mostly because of Shidou and their feelings). Even with that high and cool presence, Tooka lacks some common sense and loves food very much. Despite her lack of knowledge or experience, Tooka does have a normal sense of embarrassment, as shown by her overreacting when seen naked, or caught in otherwise embarrassing situations. At times, Tooka can be surprisingly insightful, as well as perceptive and understanding in regards to other people's feelings, especially when it concerns Shido and her fellow Spirits. She gets also along very well with Kaguya and Yuzuru, especially Kaguya because of their similar energetic personalities. However, Tooka sometimes has problems understanding the two of them, because of the weird way each of them talks. 
  
 Tooka is a highly offensive combatant who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Aside from this, Tooka also has a lot of ""mana"" within her spirit body which increases both her offensive and defensive abilities. Her primary armament is Sandalphon, which takes on the appearance of a gilded throne which doubles as the scabbard of her broadsword. Her fighting style mostly consists of either physical attacks with ""mana"" encasement on her sword and body, or a high energy attack (like a laser beam) combined with her sword. 
  
 The throne itself seems to be a sort of support machine, based on how she uses it. It can be changed into a transport vessel by laying it horizontally, or to unlock the final form of her weapon, Halvanhelev, by cutting the throne into exact halves. Later in the series, after she got her power sealed by Shido, she can retrieve a bit of her original power if she focuses hard enough or if she becomes emotional.",16,,,155 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/203347.jpg

 Piccolo is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball metaseries. He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians. 
  
 Piccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains. 
  
 Piccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain. 
  
 Piccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion 
 and is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in Fukkatsu no F . He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).

 Age: 16-17 (in the story so far) 
 Height: 163 cm 
 Blood type: B 
  
 Kyouko's life has always known only one aim—to please others. Be it her mother who didn't care much for her, or Sho's family, who took her in after she was abandoned. Suddenly, childhood friend Sho asks country bumpkin Kyouko if she wants to go to the city with him. He aims to be a big star and wishes for her support. When he commits an unthinkable crime to Kyouko's frail self-esteem, he awakens another side in her. 
  
 She changes from being an innocent girl to a woman full of the desire of revenge toward the man that used her like a stepping stone; but she didn't know that, in her way to making him suffer and cry at her feet, she would begin a whole new life into the show business and find herself having a great talent and love towards acting. 
  
 Now Kyouko is some sort of cute, joyful, and full-of-purpose woman...while also being a ""woman who holds grudges"" and acts in some crazy and unexpected ways, although she is still not able to recognize her own value and talent, and even less the way other people see her.",16-17 (in the story so far),,,163 cm,,"Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/4158/Kyouko_Mogami: Page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.

 Bondrewd is a legendary white whistle delver who has made many great discoveries about the secrets of the Abyss. A researcher fascinated by the Abyss, he has often resorted to illegal and morally questionable means to get funds for and conduct his research, including selling artifacts illicitly, developing dangerous drugs, and even experimenting on living humans. Though how cruel, he still cared for the kids and people he brutally experimented on. 
  
 His methods went against all the ethical principles of delvers, but he was allowed to continue due to his outstanding results. Ten years ago, he did the unthinkable by establishing a large base named the Idofront in the deepest area within the 5th Layer of the Abyss, as well as securing a route to the then-inviolable 6th layer. 
  
 During one of his experiments researching the Curse of the Abyss, Bondrewd offered children who wanted to unravel the secrets of the Abyss to come with him to the Ido Front. However, he never told them openly that they were going to be used as test subjects. Among the children were Nanachi and Mitty. As Bondrewd continued testing, more and more children were used up in his experiments until only Nanachi and Mitty were left. On his final test, he used both of them, resulting in Mitty being hit with the Curse of the Abyss, while Nanachi received the Blessing.

 Occupation: Hunters Association Chairman

 Abilities: 100-Type Guanyin Bodhissatva, First Hand, Third Hand, Ninety-ninth Hand, Zero Hand 
  
 None other than the Chairman of the Hunter Committee, and the final authority over the entirety of the Hunter Exam. He has enough administrative power to grant anyone the Hunter's license if he decides to do so, and enough combat power to playfully avoid attacks of the main heroes single-handedly when they challenge him. All examiners, even the most despotic ones, obey his orders without talking back. 
  
 He was said to be the strongest Nen user in the world 50 years ago, but he comments that he is already past his prime at his current age and that his subordinates might be stronger than him now (yet his direct subordinates disagree). Netero is also revealed to be older than Zeno Zoldyck (Killua's grandfather), who is said to be 67 years of age. At one point, Zeno says that when he was still a young boy, Netero was not only already old, but he is the only person alive who has fought with Maha (Zeno's) grandfather. Various stated times would put Netero over the three digit mark. He is able to use attacks faster than the speed of sound. His ability is known as 'Hyakushiki Kannon', or the '100-type Guanyin Bodhisattva'. This utilizes Nen to make the attacks seem as if they had come from another side and/or dimension, simply because they move so fast.",120,,,,Hunters Association Chairman,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/257355.jpg

 He is the series' protagonist. He has the lowest psychic rank possible at Level 0—largely because the people testing psychic abilities cannot detect or classify his abilities. His power is Imagine Breaker (幻想殺し, ""Illusion/Fantasy Killer""), a power which negates all magic, psychic, or divine powers but also his own good luck. Due to the nature of his power, the founder of Academy City considers him neither a Psychic nor a Magician but rather a normal person with a unique ability. 
  
 He tends to stay away from trouble but possesses a strong sense of justice, albeit somewhat shallow and dogmatic. He is a smart student and knowledgeable about certain subjects yet is a failure in his esper studies. While he is an idealist for the hopes of other people, ironically he is cynical about himself possibly because of his powers.",15-16,,,168 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/554288.jpg

 Rio Futaba (双葉 理央, Futaba Rio) is one of the main characters of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series, who is a second-year student at Minegahara High School. She had been in the same class as Sakuta and Yuuma during their first year and is the sole member of the Science Club. 
  
 She is a stoic and blunt girl who possesses substantial knowledge in science, including chemistry and quantum physics. She has a sharp sense of humor and is even more sarcastic and straightforward than Sakuta. Despite her stoic nature, Rio also shows various emotions such as love, as holds affection toward Yuuma, as well as anxiousness. She's also genuinely kind and loves her friends. 
  
 Rio is implied to have experienced a form of neglect. In addition, she has no siblings, which further proves that she chooses to be alone as this is her comfort zone that she unwillingly developed thanks to her lonely childhood. Although, this loneliness is what gave her the courage to approach Sakuta first when they were in the same class, as she saw him as an outcast just like her. 
  
 Before experiencing it herself, she was unwilling to believe the existence of Adolescence Syndrome, but she did acknowledge the abnormal phenomenon it induces and connects them with various scientific theories and principles. 
  
 At some point in time, Rio's feminine body parts had developed much earlier than her classmates. Once she discovered the way some boys were ogling her, she began to hate her body and felt like ""a truly filthy being.""

His ability is in manipulating plants, and he generally wields a whip created from a rose vine, complete with thorns. He is one of the wiser characters in the series and the smartest and calmest of the four main characters. 
  
 Kurama is generally regarded as the most calm and level-headed member of the group. His analytical nature is present in battle where he prefers to study the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents before devising a strategy of his own. 
  
 He is protective of those he cares about and is often merciless to anyone that poses them a threat, a shift in his usually friendly manner. In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family. 
  
 Youko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in Makai. He was considered to be an A-class demon (though he eventually surpasses that), and is said to be more than a thousand years old. 
  
 After being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Minamino Shiori, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son. 
  
 Kurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell and he can read lips. Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at low S-class power by the end of the series, he is easily the smartest fighter of the four. He relies on cunning and tactics and not necessarily power to win battles.

Khun is introduced in the Webtoon as a levelheaded character. He is from the Khun family which is one of the 10 Great Families. He is one of the ""defected sons"" of Khun Edahn and because his older sister failed to become one of Jahad's Princesses, he was driven out of his family. After being expelled from the family, he stole goods from the Khun family's treasury and decided to climb the tower. 
  
 In the Webtoon, he teamed up with Bam and Rak and continued climbing the tower with them. Khun was given the Light Bearer role and displayed great talent in manipulating the lighthouses. He is a smart and cunning Regular that uses strategies while climbing the tower rather than brute force.

 Also known as: Phantom Thief Kid, Phantom Thief 1412 
  
 Kaito Kuroba, son of legendary magician Touichi Kuroba. 
  
 One day, the mysterious phantom thief Kid (Kaitou Kid) returned after 8 years following his disappearance. On that same day, Kaito discovered that his father, who died 8 years prior, was the phantom thief Kid. Kaito confronted this new Kid, who turned out to be his father's former assistant Jii Kounosuke. From Jii, Kaito learned that his father was in fact murdered. He decided to take the identity of Kid and carry out heists in order to bait those who killed his father. 
  
 Kaito eventually met his father's murderers, and learned that their goal was to find the Pandora Gem that would grant them immortality. He swore to find the Pandora Gem before them and smash it to pieces. 
  
 In his civilian identity, Kaito is a normal, if somewhat popular, high school student. He tends to get in trouble for teasing his girl classmates, especially his childhood friend Aoko Nakamori. He also has an extreme fear of fish. 
  
 As ""Kid the Phantom Thief,"" Kaito has a calm and elegant demeanor. His most remarkable trait is the ability to disguise as anyone. His signature gadgets are the card gun and the hang glider cape. 
  
 Kaito usually returns his prize when it isn't what he looks for. 
  
 Kaito first appeared in 1987 as the main character of ""Magic Kaito,"" he only became widely known in 1997 after his appearance in ""Detective Conan"" as an antagonist. Since then, Kaito has occasionally appeared in ""Detective Conan"" manga, anime and movies, usually as an antagonist, but sometime as an ally.",17,,,"174 cm (5'8.5"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/279396.jpg

He can temporarily grow wings on his back and fly, and is capable of carrying only one person in this form. Happy apparently can fly at incredible speed as it took Eligor less than an hour to reach Clover when Happy caught up with him in mere seconds with Natsu in tow). This is also the only kind of transportation that does not make Natsu sick. When asked why, Natsu got angry and exclaimed that Happy was a friend, not a means of transportation, ironically Natsu later gets sick when Gray gives him a piggyback ride when he's injured. He's very close to Natsu and becomes friends with Lucy quickly. The three form a team at the start of the manga. Happy is a full-fledged member of Fairy Tail, and has a member stamp on his back. It's also unknown if Happy even though being a mage and a member of Fairy Tail, can use his magic offensively or not. 
  
 Happy has a very cheerful nature. Even when facing danger, he maintains a smile. Along with Lucy, he is one of the saner members of Fairy Tail and often acts as the mediator between Natsu and Gray. 
  
 Happy's original name was going to be named Freyr, after a Norse god. But Hiro Mashima felt it didn't fit him, so he changed the name to Happy to fit the character.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/365287.jpg

 Bench press: 75 kg 
 Height: 176 cm

 Birthday: February 7 
 Hair: Blond (Originally black but he bleached it) 
 Eyes: Emerald Green 
  
 Hiruma usually acts in a vulgar, bizarre, threatening manner so as to intimidate or disturb those around him into getting what he wants. He has a cunning, goal-oriented mind and does not seem to care what means he uses to accomplish those goals. His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his ""Book of Threats"" or ""Devil's Handbook,"" and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma's mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. 
  
 Despite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma ""does everything else to win"" and is ""only concerned with winning."" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play. 
  
 He addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with ""Fucking"" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as ""Shorty"" for Sena or ""Monkey"" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma's attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma's 'true' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior —allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma's actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on.",,,,176 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/61939.jpg

 Height: 185 cm (6'1"") 
 Weight: 69 kg (152.1 lbs) 
 Zanpakuto: Shinso 
  
 Gin is fairly ordinary in terms of clothing, aside from the inside of his captain's cloak being a lime green color, and doesn't wear any unique items. His overall appearance, however, is not as normal: his eyes are constantly slitted, he is unusually thin, and he bears unusual silver hair which has a purple tint to it in the anime. He also keeps a wide smile most of the time, which he has only been known to wipe off on rare occasions. 
  
 As Gin doesn't display any emotion while speaking combined with his use of sarcasm, he is distrusted by many, most notably Toshiro Hitsugaya and Rukia Kuchiki. Rukia once commented on how she felt like snakes were wrapping around her neck whenever Gin spoke. Kaname Tousen notes that Gin has a similar effect on just about everyone when explaining Wonderwice Margera's frightened reaction to Gin. In the anime, Gin speaks with a distinct Kyoto dialect, which is indirect and polite. His English dubbed voice is also formal and polite, but with a rather mocking and facetious undertone. 
  
 Gin is often nicknamed ""Kitsune"" (Fox-Faced) from Ichigo. 
  
 Not much is known about Gin's prior history, except that he once saved 10th Division Lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto's life. They have been friends since then. Hence, Matsumoto is one of the few people Gin seems to truly care about. 
  
 He graduated from Shinigami academy around the same time as Kisuke Urahara became a captain and was immediately given a seated position because he was hailed a genius, graduating in only a year at a very young age, this being the fasted graduation in history. 
  
 It is also known that Gin served as the lieutenant of 5th Division Captain Sosuke Aizen before becoming captain of the 3rd Division and that he became captain at the same time as Byakuya Kuchiki.",,,,"185 cm (6'1"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/98077.jpg

 Mami is a veteran magical girl and a third-year student at Madoka's school. She lives alone in a penthouse after the death of her parents in a car accident, one which she was able to survive only due to contracting with Kyubey to save her own life. 
  
 Mami is particularly focused on saving those around her, with a traditionally selfless perspective on the role of magical girl, and has a habit of giving names to her finishing attacks. Though her outward disposition is cheery and confident, Mami feels deeply alone as she has no friends to confide in or support her as she fights. Due to her desire to save as many people as she can, Mami tends to clash with other Puella Magi who would rather wait for witches to ""mature"" in order to obtain Grief Seeds, despite that resulting in human casualties.

All though he may look intimidating, he is really friendly and (overly)affectionate, and often stays behind or risks his life for the safety of others. He also has a tendency to show off techniques passed down to him to his enemies, and make them feel somewhat awkward during a battle.

 Abilities: Psychokinesis

 Level: S-Class; Rank: 2

 Relatives: Fubuki (Younger sister) 
  
 Tatsumaki is the S-Class, Rank 2 superhero and the older sister of Fubuki. 
  
 Tatsumaki is a petite woman, commonly mistaken for being much younger than she really is. She has a youthful face with wide emerald green eyes and hair that curls up on the ends. She wears a formfitting black dress with long sleeves and four high-cut leg slits that show off her legs and low-heeled black shoes. 
  
 Being the second ranked S-Class hero, Tatsumaki is very powerful. She is one of the most powerful heroes and the most powerful esper alive. Fubuki describes her as a monster much like Amai Mask, who chooses not to advance from A-Class to S-Class to not allow weaklings to rank up. Even after witnessing Saitama's display of power in the fight against her, Fubuki is convinced that Saitama is nowhere near her older sister in terms of strength and fighting ability.

 He dedicated his cause not to endorse terrorism or rebellion, which he believed would only result in the pointless killing. Unwilling to sacrifice the innocent, he also had a strong sense of loyalty, never questioning the orders of his superiors. Despite that, elders showed him to be willing to stab them in the back if necessary. Suzaku also wished to take responsibility for his actions, and his ultimate goal was to atone for the killing of his father.

529,"Shirayuki, Mizore(白雪 みぞれ)",Rosario to VampireRosario to Vampire Capu2,3910,https://myanimelist.net/character/8129/Mizore_Shirayuki,"Birthday: December 7 
 Height: 156 cm 
 Weight: 45 kg 
 Three sizes: 83-56-85 
  
 Mizore Shirayuki is a yuki-onna who is in the same homeroom class as Tsukune and Moka, frequently seen with a lollipop in her mouth. Her outfit consists of a white wide-necked sweater with blue sleeves over a black tank top, a short plaid yellow skirt which is part of the Yokai Academy's girls' uniform, pink and violet stockings (her right stocking slightly longer than her left), and a belt that is wrapped around her left thigh. 
  
 Mizore returns to school after a delayed absence and was first portrayed as a lonely, somewhat depressed, and misunderstood girl. She becomes infatuated with Tsukune, going so far as to create her own journal/scrapbook with all of his newspaper articles. 
  
 In the past, she confessed her love to a teacher until he began taking advantage of her, freezing him as a result. With the incident and rumors spreading about her, Mizore made it hard for herself to trust anyone, but took a liking to Tsukune, believing he was just as miserable as she was. She eventually regains her sense of trust after Tsukune intervenes when the same teacher returns to kill her. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis (from around 340 spying locations, according to her). She initially sports long hair in her debut appearances, but cuts it short after the incident was cleared. Later in the second serialization, Mizore decides that even if Tsukune doesn't fall in love with her, she will follow him forever. 
  
 A running gag in the series is that Mizore always appears unexpectedly in the oddest locations (under tables, behind doors, the ceiling, bushes, and even in the bathroom), and freezes any girl to disrupt any sort of tender moment Tsukune is having with the latter. 
  
 Keeping in line with her kind, Mizore has the ability to control snow and ice at will, and while doing so, shapes claws of ice around her hands (her hair becomes ice on rare occasions). She can also make almost perfect copies (if a bit fragile) of herself and others with it as well, each capable of independent thought. She is also very sensitive to flames, a common weakness for ice-affiliated creatures, which was shown in one episode of the anime when she got her hand burned while preparing curry, freezing the dish on instinct as a result.

 Likes: Taiyaki 
 Dislikes: Perverts 
 English name: Golden Darkness 
  
 A dispassionate, withdrawn assassin, Golden Darkness is hired by one of Lala's arranged suitors, Lacospo to kill Rito, until she breaks the contract, noting the true nature behind her target. Golden Darkness is currently staying on Earth, roaming around the city streets and Sainan High, with a motivation to continue her duty to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this (hinting she only said this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed). Commonly referred as ""Yami-chan"", she spends her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it was the only thing she ate on Earth since it was the first food offered by Rito, prior to spending a night at the Yuuki residence for a sukiyaki dinner). By her planet's calculations, she is 24 thousand years-old (as shown in season 1 where the job applicant stops Konjiki no Yami just before she was about to say 'thousand'), despite having the appearance of an 11-year-old (albeit a rather mature one), although this is only mentioned in the anime and has a weakness towards anything slimy. 
  
 Like Lala, Golden Darkness' physical abilities are exponentially stronger than a human's. She carries a unique ability to turn her body parts into various objects through use of nano machines circulating her body, ranging from swords to dragon heads. Unfortunately, excessive use becomes a hazard to her health. She states she hates ""ecchi"" people, and does not hesitate to assault a person who looks at her in an obscene way, even if it's her own fault like when she was using her abilities to increase her bust she attacks Rito when he saw her, mostly out of embarrassment or for many occasions standing at the top of something such as stairs where her panties could be seen by accident. She has also stated, that she doesn't understand if she can feel love and all its wonders, though she slowly becomes closer to Rito once seeing that he is a good person.",,,,153 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/226347.jpg

 Birthday: December 1 
 Zodiac: Sagittarius 
 Blood Type: AB 
  
 Ikuto Tsukiyomi is a teenage boy contracted by Easter to find the Embryo. He often helps Amu even though he works for Easter. Ikuto actually despises Easter and tries to wrench himself free from them by trying to find the Embryo to grant his own wish. He possesses the Dumpty Key which pairs with Amu's Humpty Lock which at first did not fit in the keyhole. Like his father, Ikuto is a skilled violinist. 
  
 His Shugo Chara is Yoru. 
  
 Anon Black's Profile of Ikuto: 
  
 Ikuto is tall, wears dark clothing, and has dark blue hair. He's got a signature smirk that can mean both ""I'm flirting"" and ""I'm pleased with what you just said."" His Chara-Change gives him cat ears and a tail, and causes him to behave much like a cat. His Chara-Nari is Black Lynx. 
  
 Ikuto plays the violin, and is the son of a famous violinist. His father married his mother, who was the heir to Easter. The company ordered that he drop everything, including his violin, for Easter. His father refused and disappeared, leaving Ikuto's mother in such distress that she was admitted to a hospital. Ikuto came to live with Tadase's family, but was treated harshly by Tadase's mother, who was jealous of her husband's relationship with Ikuto's mother. Eventually, Ikuto ran away from home, going to Tsukasa's home for an unspecified amount of time, and returning a few years before the current time to Tadase's house. There he was found by Tadase's dog, Betty, who was dead, and Tadase's grandmother, who had collapsed. Ikuto was cursed out once again, but not until he'd stolen away Tadase's Dumpty Key, which Tadase's father had given to his son when Ikuto's father left. 
  
 Because of this, Tadase and Ikuto have a very strained relationship, if any. 
  
 Ikuto's personality as a child was quiet, shy, and protective of his friends—when he accepts the blame for breaking the vase, even when he knew he'd be chastised for it. This part of his personality stays through his adolescence—he is more than willing to sacrifice himself for the ones he holds dear, even if it means a few nights alone on the street, being captured by Easter, or playing the villain and making himself hated. 
  
 It's obvious that Ikuto cares very much about Amu, and probably has a crush on her, especially in the way he acts with her in chapters 28-30. He seems to only show his true colors, and talk about himself, when he is in her presence. Of course, this is the way Peach-Pit has presented it to us. 
  
 Ikuto acts aloof, cold, flirtatious, and mysterious. He appears at will, and is openly defiant of his superiors in Easter. It's obvious he doesn't like working there, and has his own reasons for wanting the Embryo that have yet to be revealed. He takes joy in teasing and flirting with Amu, especially in her reactions. 
  
 In Shugo Chara! Doki, he stays at Easter to protect Utau. He doesn't even get near her, so that she won't have anything to do with Easter anymore.

When he was younger, he had a run-in with a group of gangsters, and was shot at. All of the gangster's shots missed, and that is where he saw an opportunity to pick up a gun, take aim, and shoot them all in the head. He was sentenced to prison for the rest of teenage years, and was eventually bailed out by Bucciarati, and passed Polpo's test. Guido tends to use a revolver as his firearm, and believes the number 4 is unlucky due to events from his childhood and the character for 4 in Japanese sounds similar to the word ""die."" 
  
 Sex Pistols is a stand composed of Six bullet like ""people"" living inside a gun, numbered from 1 to 7 (with no number 4). Guido can control the bullets to hit any direction and can do tasks when instructed to. Each ""person"" has different personalities, love to eat, if not fed, they will not work. It is very similar to Hol Horse's The Emperor.

 Neji Hyuuga is a stoic member of Might Guy's Team Guy, consisting of himself, Rock Lee, and Tenten. Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a ""failure"" such as himself can defeat a ""genius"" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do. 
  
 As a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji possesses Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie. 
  
 Because his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. 
  
 After the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills. This helps ease some of the tensions between the two branches of the Hyuuga clan.

She has roundish blue eyes and black hair going down to her hips tied in a twin tail fashion with a white ribbon on each tail. She has a small stature which further emphasizes her big breasts; hence the nickname ""Loli Big-boobs."" Hestia's usual attire is a white one-piece dress with blue ribbons on her collar and one just below the chest that goes around her arms, and a pair of white gloves. She is frequently barefoot, but does occasionally wear a pair of white flip-flops. 
  
 Hestia is an energetic, kind goddess who sees potential in Bell. She is a hard worker, and works jobs to support the two while Bell goes off to the dungeon. Hestia tends to be shown as very petty and gets jealous easily when girls, namely Aizu, show interest in Bell, because she is deeply in love with him, or they are the reason for his strength growth. Hestia is shown to have a lewd side, as she often sneaks into Bell's bed and sleeps with him, even getting overjoyed about it. Despite seeming mature and dependable toward Bell, Hestia is in truth, a lazy goddess, as she couldn't get a job or put effort into work until her friends kicked her out and shown to be a glutton, always eating food from others as she couldn't pay for meals. 
  
 After descending to the Lower World, Hestia was taken care of by her friend, Hephaestus but was soon asked to live on her own and gave her a room at an abandoned church. 
  
 Hestia tried to create her own familia but wasn't able recruit even a single person. After failing to recruit for the 50th time, she noticed Bell Cranel and decided to secretly follow him. Hestia noticed that Bell was trying to enter a familia but was rejected multiple times and is in the same boat as her. Hestia then took the chance to recruit him which Bell happily agreed upon; becoming the first member of her familia. She took Bell to a bookstore, the location she already decided beforehand, and granted ""God's Grace"" to her first dependent.

 Weight: 43 kg 
 Sizes: 98-61-84 
  
 Stocking is a main character in the Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt series. She is a gothic female angel, with long violet/pink hair and teal eyes. Stocking is the younger of the Anarchy sisters. Like Panty, her name derives from the object she is able to weaponize. 
  
 She is a level-headed and intelligent girl, though, she can be rude if provoked, especially towards her older sister, Panty. Stocking enjoys eating various desserts and sugary food, but doesn't seem to gain weight (she assures all the fat goes towards her breasts anyway). However, she becomes enraged and sensitive whenever someone calls her fat. 
  
 Stocking is often considered to be the personification of the deadly sin, Gluttony, due to her obsession with sweets. She does not share Panty's obsession with sex, even though she does display some masochistic tendencies, such as bondage, vore and electrocution, which is ironic considering she constantly insults the demon sisters and Corset affinity for similar fetishes by calling them 'BDSM loving freaks'. Stocking does claim she has very special standards in men, and prefers love over lust. She strings men along (not wanting them to believe she is 'easy'), and would never cheat on someone she truly loves. However, she has been shown to have a very strange and twisted vision of what she finds attractive. 
  
 Stocking hates spicy food, just as much as Panty hates sweet food. Stocking is sometimes overshadowed by Panty when in larger audiences due to the latter's more sensuous and exhibitionist behavior, such as in ""Sex and the Daten City"" and ""1 Angry Ghost."" She is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat, Honekoneko, whose expressions often match Stocking's mood. 
  
 Abilities 
 To prepare for battle, Stocking removes her stockings. Her ability is being able to transform her stockings into a pair of katanas, known as Stripes I & II, which can be attached at the base of the hilt. It's safe to assume she can form other blades as well, considering the range of weaponry at Panty's disposal.",,,,1.52m,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/101434.jpg

Yatora feels like his life is dull and predictable, that is, until he comes across his senpai, Mori, painting in the Art Club. He discovers his passion for painting and dedicates his remaining school years to it, aiming to pass Tokyo University of the Arts entrance exam. 
  
 Although Yatora is very hardworking and looks composed, there is an underlying insecure part of him that is further exposed when he starts making art. He is an extroverted character, who can easily understand what others are looking for in a relationship and adapts himself to please everyone around him. For that reason, he tends to oppress his own feelings and wishes. Yatora relies a lot on his studied social skills whenever he is under a stressful or unfamiliar situation, but when he is caught by surprise or can't keep up his composed act his feelings outburst, often making him cry, and speak for himself. 
  
 Yatora is especially hard on himself, with high standards while constantly undervaluing his work and comparing himself to others which ends up overwhelming him. Whilst comparing himself with others, he has great respect and admires the art people around him create. His selfless and worried nature is better shown when he goes on a trip with Ryuji despite him being in between exams and is breaking out in rashes due to extreme stress.

 Sex: male (in his main form); can be female 
 Age: ~800 years (according to books about him) 
 Relatives: The Beholder (""father,"" creator); March (adoptive ""mother""); Gugu (adoptive brother) 
 Affiliation: The Guardian Force (formerly); Tonari's Group (formerly); Booze Man's Shop (formerly); Aoki Family (currently) 
  
 Fushi is an immortal being that can take the form of anything that has given him stimuli. 
  
 His original form was a featureless white sphere. Without consciousness, he copied the first thing he bumped into, which happened to be a rock. Soon afterward, he became moss and stayed like that for some time. When a wounded wolf wandered close in the middle of winter and died, the immortal copied the wolf. He retains the ability to turn into these things. 
  
 Later, after the death of The Nameless Boy, he mimicked the boy's appearance and took the form of a young boy with white hair, pale complexion, and green eyes. He wears a short, brown fur cloak and a light blue shirt and pants with fur boots. A rope dangled from his hand and neck as The Nameless Boy died holding Joaan's leash, though the latter soon disappeared. The injury that took The Boy's life is also present on Fushi's left leg. Fushi commented that this form felt like it belonged to him the most.",~800 years (according to books about him),,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/414023.jpg
561,"Samejima, Mamimi(サメジマ・マミ美)",FLCL,3680,https://myanimelist.net/character/632/Mamimi_Samejima,"Mamimi Samejima, 17, was Tasuku's girlfriend, though she hits on Naota since his brother left Japan. She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and was once seen smoking worn cigarette with ""Never Knows Best"" written onto the paper. 
  
 She has the peculiar tendency to name people and things ""Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),"" after her personal nickname for Naota's brother (and Naota himself). The ""-kun"" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as ""Ta-kun"" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother's name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku ""Tasuku-sempai"" since he is an older classmate. 
  
 The story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota's classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive—although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her—only to have her plan backfire. 
  
 Mamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it'd be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military. 
  
 As far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother's replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds ""If I don't, I'll overflow."" 
  
 Most characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as ""Naota's Wife"" and Haruko calls her ""Sameji,"" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as ""that high school girl.""

Being an expert in apparitions field, he solves Koyomi and others' problems. Although he sometimes expects compensation, he does not require it always and seems to help those in need from good nature.

 Oshino is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with Senjougahara and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross.

 Birthday: April 8 
 Height: 165 cm 
 Weight: 45 kg 
 Sizes: 82-54-81 
  
 Kirino is Kyosuke's 14-year-old younger sister. She is mature for her age with a cold, tsundere-like personality. She has a strong ""little sister"" fetish and owns many adult games with older brother/little sister themes, relying on a modeling job to pay for them. Despite this, she states she does not know why she started liking it, though it is suggested that she has a brother complex and is using the games as a surrogate to this. She often denies such feelings and believes the 2D and 3D worlds should be kept separate. 
  
 As a student, Kirino possesses a keen focus to studying and athletics. This attitude of hers when it comes to school activities has rewarded her with above-average marks, even as she enters the career of modeling. She developed a sort of perfectionist attitude due to becoming an overachiever, which eventually made her more prone to struggling when the odds are against her. When these moments come, however, she displays a more passive side. 
  
 Upon her initial interactions with Kyousuke, she demonstrates an attitude similar to a ""tsundere,"" with the bossy and abusive part more dominant. Although she maintains this attitude, she slowly tries to open up to her brother at times, reluctantly expressing gratitude on things that Kyousuke has done for her.",14–16,,,165 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/101419.jpg

 Shirayuki is a bright and resourceful girl, determined, able to speak her mind, and knowledgeable in both botany and medicine. Whenever there is a problem or conflict, she often takes matters into her own hands. She later learns to rely on others, especially Zen. 
  
 Due to her rare hair color, Shirayuki gets a proposal to be a concubine of the foolish but famous prince Raji. As she cannot decline it, she escapes to the neighboring country. While traveling, she meets a boy named Zen, who accidentally gets injured, and she boldly cures his wounds. They become friends, and she finds out than Zen is actually a prince of that country, and he saves her from being taken by Raji. They later go to his palace, where she applies for the job of ""Palace Pharmacist,"" to be able to go freely to the castle where Zen is.",18,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/229461.jpg

 Birthday: December 6th 
  
 Mahiru's appearance is consistently described as beautiful. Her straight, well-groomed, flaxen blond hair is silky smooth and lustrous. Her large caramel-colored eyes are framed by long lashes on both the top and bottom. Additionally, she has pale, milky-white skin that is soft and flawless, and a shapely nose. 
  
 Her clothing choices are trendy yet high-quality and practical. They are modest and not too revealing, reflecting her humble and unassuming personality. 
  
 Due to her parents' abandonment, both physically and emotionally, Mahiru was raised by Koyuki-san, a housekeeper. This has made her very withdrawn, much like a lone flower in an unreachable place. She hides her thoughts and feelings behind a figurative mask, appearing angelic but distant. Mahiru excels in cooking, impressing Amane, his friends, and his parents. She is also very organized, practical, and frugal, easily managing household tasks. 
  
 Mahiru excels both academically and athletically, often ranking at the top of her class with perfect scores. She is a tireless worker who strives to make her achievements seem effortless. 
  
 Mahiru is an innocent, cute, kind, and loving person with a strong moral compass and a deep generosity. She goes out of her way to help others when she feels safe doing so. While she maintains a guarded demeanor, especially regarding her parents, she avoids lying and tends to become reserved or cold when discussing past trauma. Her private honesty emerges more clearly when she is alone, though she never expresses it harshly. 
  
 Mahiru has some social awkwardness, particularly in close relationships, often making gestures that might be misinterpreted. She also struggles with self-confidence and is often surprised by, and relieved from, genuine compliments from Amane. 
  
 Mahiru, being the most popular girl at school, primarily interacts with other female students due to the frequent and unwanted attention from boys who are infatuated with her. She dislikes this attention and is cautious about trusting strangers. To keep people at a distance and protect her privacy, she readily lies or obfuscates the details of her life. Despite these efforts, she maintains an impeccable image, always appearing polite and humble about her achievements, which further reinforces her perfect reputation among her peers.

He was also Death Scythe’s first partner (Maka's mother was the second). He was also the most powerful technician to ever graduate from the school, Shibusen. He has a bolt going through his head which turns so his thoughts would be on the matter at hand. He mostly moves by pushing his chair in the direction he wants to go even if it ends up with him crashed on the floor. Stein is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still seated in his chair. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment or specimen. He even experimented on Spirit (now Death Scythe) when he was sleeping during the five years they worked together. His understanding of soul wavelengths gives him a huge advantage against other users since he can change his own to match the other’s wavelength and thereby nullify or disrupt the soul frequency of the technician and weapon. This comes from his high spiritual flexibility and by observing his opponent beforehand. His soul wavelength is so high that he doesn’t need a weapon and can channel it through his body and release it out of his body as electric discharge. He has a strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting. He is also the school doctor; he still respects Spirit and still calls him Senpai. 
  
 Other than his electric charges, he uses a repertoire of other techniques such as Soul Sutures, a technique which binds people to e.g. the ground via a soul wavelength (the technique is costly, it requires so much attention the wielder cannot move), Witch Hunter (the technique Maka uses) when he is using Spirit as a weapon, and the ability to cancel out direct soul attacks by matching wavelengths (explained earlier).",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/524076.jpg

 Age: 19 
 Chakra Element: Doton 
 Height: 166 cm 
 Weight: 50.8 kg 
 Blood Type: AB 
 Zodiac: Taurus 
 Occupation: Akatsuki member 
  
 Deidara is a missing-nin from Iwagakure. Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him. 
  
 In battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command ""Katsu"" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between ""C1"" to ""C4"", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack. For his final act, Deidara also has a mouth on his chest that, once provided with clay, turns him into a living bomb that destroys everything in a 10 kilometer radius.

 Height: 192 cm 
 Weight: 87 kg 
 Race: Shinigami 
 Birthday: July 11th 
 Zodiac: Cancer 
 Zanpakuto: Katen Kyoukotsu 
 Theme Song: Carlos Gardel's ""Por una Cabeza"" 
  
 Kyouraku is a laid back and flamboyant man, evident in his style of dress and general attitude. He wears a straw hat and a pink flowered haori over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pinwheel hairpin is very expensive. In his off time, he can be seen drinking sake and napping. Other times, he likes to chase after women, which is noted by Yasochika Iemura of the 4th Squad when commenting in his diary. In particular, he often flirts with his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls 'my Nanao-chan' (little Nanao). In one of the omake outtakes he told Rangiku Matsumoto to buy Nanao Ise a sexy outfit while in the human world. Matsumoto brings back a skimpy two piece bathing suit which Nanao refuses to try on. He is close friends with 13th Division Captain Jushiro Ukitake, with whom he graduated from the shinigami academy and works with often. 
  
 Kyouraku tends to use a more familiar speech style than most other characters in Bleach. He generally refers to his fellow captains and shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific, and is the only character who dispenses with honorifics when addressing General Yamamoto, calling him old Yama (Yama-jī). Even Ukitake, who was also taught by Yamamoto, does not do this. 
  
 Kyouraku is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of a fight. However, he does not wish to insult his opponents by not fighting, either, as he explains to Chad. Since he has achieved the rank of captain, it is implied that he must be a powerful fighter, but the true extent of his abilities has not been seen in the series. General Yamamoto states that Kyouraku and Jushiro Ukitake, both of whom he trained himself, possess ""greater powers on the battlefield than any younger generation, or old,"" suggesting that the two are more powerful than any other captains, with the possible exception of Yamamoto himself. 
  
 The slightly eccentric Kyouraku also seems to like making an impression on opponents. In the Soul Society arc, when Kyouraku confronts Chad who had invaded the 8th division area, he has Nanao Ise scatter rose petals over him to make a dramatic entrance. It creates this effect at first, but when Nanao doesn't stop dropping the petals and Kyouraku begins to exhort her to stop in an embarrassing manner, she dumps the whole basket on him, burying him and ruining his entrance.",,,,192 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/33242.jpg

 Ais Wallenstein, also known as the Sword Princess, is a First-Class Adventurer and a key member of the Loki Familia. Among the small fraction of First-Class Adventurers, she is considered one of the strongest. 
 Ais is a quiet  person who doesn't talk much, and is bad at expressing her feelings through words. Ais is shown to be serious and merciless toward monsters during her missions. Ais is believed to be an airhead, namely due to her quiet nature. Ais is very strong-willed, doing everything to reach her goal: ""to become even stronger"". Ais appears to be somewhat clueless toward people confessing their love toward her, and rejects anyone asking for courtship. She also tends to react violently whenever someone does anything remotely perverted to her 
  
 Ais entered Loki’s Familia at the age of 7. In the underground dungeon she carried everybody’s luggage. Ais was able to reach Level 2 within a year, and became the fastest person to reach Level 2 at that time, until Bell Cranel broke that record and they make up each other.

594,"Wolfwood, Nicholas D.(ニコラス・D・ウルフウッド)",TrigunTrigun: Badlands RumbleTrigun Stampede,3437,https://myanimelist.net/character/722/Nicholas_D_Wolfwood,"When Vash's bus runs across Wolfwood's motorcycle in the middle of the desert. He proves to be a valuable ally although his and Vash's philosophies often conflict, Wolfwood being a firm believer in martialism while Vash is a pacifist. By the end of the series, he agrees with Vash's way of thinking even though it costs him dearly. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs. 
  
 The giant cross that he carries comes in two versions. Version 1 holds 12 pistols (across arms of the cross). Version 2 houses a giant machine gun (long part of the cross) and finally, a rocket launcher in the top, while the ammunition is stored in the arms of the cross(an alternate opinion is simply that one of the horizontal arms holds ammo for the machine gun and rocket launcher while the other holds six pistols). The trigger for the Version 2 is a skull shaped symbol in the centre of the cross. As can be expected, the weapon/case is very heavy, and only Wolfwood, Milly, and Vash seem to have no trouble holding it (though Vash once comments on its weight). The weapon is not actually named in the anime, but it is commonly referred to as Punisher, which comes from the manga. Wolfwood states that it's heavy ""with God's mercy,"" a fitting statement from the cynical Wolfwood. 
  
 He is modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto, the lead singer of the Japanese rock band Ulfuls. The name Wolfwood (ウルフウッド urufuddo) is a corruption of Ulfuls (ウルフルズ urufuruzu), which is in turn a corruption of the English word soulful (ソウルフル sōrufuru). 
  
 Nightow is frequently asked in interviews and at convention panels what the ""D."" in Wolfwood's name stands for. His responses have varied each time, ranging from ""Dangerous"" to ""Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora."" The latter is actually stereotypical yakuza slang, and would be written out as ""どこの組の者じゃ、われ！？　簀巻きにして沈めたろか、こら！"", which roughly means ""What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!"". The common theme in these various expansions of the single letter ""D"" is one of destructive force, anger, or violence, which are traits Nightow has modeled the character after. 
  
 In the original Japanese version, Wolfwood speaks in a Kansai Dialect. Nightow has said of this: ""It's an English-speaking world, so he's not actually speaking Kansai dialect. Think of it as indicating some accent.""",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/89610.jpg

 Birthdate: November 3, 1992 
  
 Eiji Nizuma is a high school genius mangaka who has been drawing ever since he was young. Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi consider him their rival. He was supposed to serialize a manga titled Yellow Hit but he wanted to draw a different manga, Crow , which appeared in Akamaru Jump instead. His assistants were initially Nakai and Fukuda (Mashiro also worked for him temporarily before Detective Trap was serialized). His editor is Hattori Yujiro. He once demanded to be allowed to end one series he hated if he ever made it as the most popular author in Jump. 
  
 Niizuma is slightly naive but can also be serious and calculating when he wants to. Eiji tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he grew more humble, even claiming to not be ""good enough of a mangaka to be judging other people's work"" when asked by his editor to judge for the Golden Future Cup. (He judges anyway but is not very helpful, only expressing his interest in Ashirogi and Ryu Shizuka). 
  
 Niizuma tends to make noises and sound effects when drawing or writing his manga. He is constantly chastised by his editor, and at first seems to be rather oblivious toward his rivals' feelings toward him, even expressing great excitement when he meets Ashirogi Muto and saying he is their fan. He is a great lover of manga and his opinion are valued by everyone at Jump, including his rivals. He refers to himself as an ""Eternal Boy,"" and that is why he writes shounen manga.

 Birthday: August 10 
 Zodiac: Leo 
 Hair: Black (purple highlights) 
 Eyes: Light Olive Green (bandage over left eye) 
 Height: 170 cm 
 Weight: 60 kg 
 Occupation: Leader of the Kiheitai 
 Hobbies: Smoking a pipe, Playing a shamisen 
  
 A former comrade of Gintoki and Katsura and a major antagonist. He now leads a radical Joui faction called the Kiheitai and is known amongst the Shinsengumi as 'the most dangerous man in both the Joui faction and amongst the radicals.' He is easily recognizable through his bandaged left eye, his colorful kimono, his eerie smile, and the pipe he is often seen smoking. 
  
 He, Gintoki, and Katsura studied in the same temple elementary school when they were children, and he fought with them against the Amanto invasion during the latter part of the Joui war. After the war ended, he vanished, and has since gained a dangerous reputation due to his assassination of many of the Bakufu's main officers and his planning of a large-scale coup d'etat. Before his first appearance in both the anime and the manga, he was mentioned to have fled Edo and to have been hiding in Kyoto, although it is unclear how long before this was. 
  
 He now believes that the only way to save it is to destroy the ""rotten"" post-Joui war world. 
  
 He is shown to like festivals, although this is mainly due to the opportunity they provide for a large-scale terrorist attack: he appears to have an attraction to ruin that is almost nihilistic. He also appears to have considerable insight due to his 'seeing through Itou's heart' and subsequently planting him in the Shinsengumi's ranks. 
  
 It can be assumed that he is as skilled a swordsman as both Gintoki and Katsura, having fought alongside them as one of the 'heroes' of the Joui war. That aside, he appears to have at least considerable skill in playing the shamisen, and is shown at one point playing it with Bansai as they talk. 
  
 He is based on the historical Takasugi Shinsaku.

 San is known as Princess Mononoke and is the princess of the spirits and beasts. When San was a baby, her parents, along with some other travelers, were attacked by the wolf goddess Moro. Her parents threw San to Moro as a sacrifice to save their own lives, thus escaping while Moro was preoccupied with San. 
  
 However, San was spared; Moro did not eat her, and instead, raised San as her own daughter. San treats Moro as her mother and her two natural pups as brothers. San rejects her own humanity, thinking of herself as a wolf. Possibly because of her past, San hates humans with a great ferocity, even more so than Moro. She wears a coat made of wolf hide and carries a dagger made from the tooth of a wolf. 
  
 San cares very much for the forest she lives in and the animals she lives with. San is very agile, able to dodge arrows, darts, and even ishibiya shots. She, like the Mountain Spirits, wants to destroy the humans so that they will stop taking away all their land. She personally wants to kill Eboshi, the leader of Iron Town.

609,Yami Yuugi(闇の遊戯),Yu☆Gi☆Oh! Duel MonstersYu☆Gi☆Oh!Yu☆Gi☆Oh! Hikari no Pyramid,3332,https://myanimelist.net/character/1375/Yami_Yuugi,"Age: 3000+ 
 Blood type: A 
 Height: 153 cm 
 Weight: 42 kg 
  
 Yami Yuugi is the spirit of the ancient Pharaoh residing in the Millennium Puzzle. His past is shrouded in mystery. 3,000 (5,000 in the dub) years later, Yuugi Mutou, after trying to solve the puzzle for eight years, awakens the Pharaoh from his slumber, although Yuugi does not realize this until much later in the story. At the end of Duelist Kingdom, the Pharaoh asks Yuugi to help him recover his memories and Yuugi agrees to help him. 
  
 In the early manga, Dark Yugi starts out as an merciless vigilante. He emerges to deal justice to people who trespass the souls of Yugi and his friends. Although his acts are righteous, he lives up to his namesake of Dark; his Penalty Game punishments are usually very brutal. Later, while living inside Yugi's body, he seems to become more of a caring, nice and friendly disposition, even though he always had that in him, and the friendship of Yugi's friends had helped it be revealed to others. Yami is a strong, powerful and skilled Pharaoh. He attempts to balance darkness and evil in his use of the Shadow Magic from his Millennium Item. Unlike Yami Bakura and Yami Marik, he never uses it for personal gain, instead preferring to help others in need, and to inflict punishment only on people who have severely wronged innocents. He is slightly reserved, as he doesn't reveal his existence to Yugi or his friends. At first Yugi feared Yami Yugi, but after Yugi admits to thinking ""another Yugi"" exists inside him, his friends become aware of his existence and accepted him as a friend. Even before, Yami is extremely protective of Yugi. 
  
 Yami's pride is his greatest strength and weakness. Initially he refuses to lose games, because it would cause him to lose the chance to save Grandpa. This has caused him to almost kill Seto Kaiba by attacking his monster while he stood on a ledge and the shockwaves could cause him to fall if Yugi chose to win the Duel (in the Japanese version, Kaiba threatened to commit suicide should he lose).  Learning how to lose became an essential aspect of Yami's journey, which he is tested in the Battle Ritual. Yami is also wise and intelligent. He knows all the rules and details of how the game is played, as well as those of all games. He also knows several special game techniques, such as the Double Hit dice roll technique, which, when two dice are used and the one with the weak spin stops first, lets him make the dice that's already spinning hit the one that isn't, allowing him to change its number, which is done by bumping the field with a body part, e.g the elbow. Despite being an ancient Pharaoh, Yami is very quick to learning and utilizing modern technology. He, despite initial shock, was able to quickly grasp the concept of holographic technology, how Dueling Arenas and field Power Bonuses worked, was able to use the Dungeon Dice Monsters Help computer to quickly formulate strategies, and was able to use Duel Disks flawlessly on the first try. Yami is also capable of translating the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, figuring out the riddles or clues and what they mean. Through Yugi and his friends, Yami Yugi learns the values and powers of friendship and unity. After seeing Yugi overcome Marik in his Duel with Jonouchi, who has been possessed, Yami thinks to himself, he learned something from Yugi; that in kindness lies the greatest strength of all; one day Yugi will surpass him. Also, Yami has been protecting Yugi, and Yugi has learned from him the spirit of ""never shrink back no matter how difficult it is"". At the end of the story, Yugi grows enough to be self-reliant, and Yami's soul gets freedom.

Feitan seldom speaks, but when he does, usually there's a word missing. Feitan's first language most likely isn't Japanese, but he has shown to be rather proficient in the Chinese language. He is one of the original members hailing from Ryūseigai. After Feitan's victory over Zazan in Ryūseigai, he has been granted temporary control over the Genei Ryoudan. 
  
 Feitan is an assassin down to his core, and is quite skilled at his profession. His movement is incredibly fast; Feitan is able to leave afterimages of his body due to his rapid steps. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun that fires needles inside for hidden attacks. 
  
  Nen Abilities 
 Pain Packer: the ability allows Feitan to first use his aura to materialize a protective armor. Then, all of the damage that he has received in battle into scorching heat (named ""Rising Sun"") and is emitted into the air. The emitted nen transforms into a miniature sun that burns the victim to death. Rising Sun has a very large attack radius, and while Feitan is within his armor he will not be harmed by the fire.

622,"Inoue, Orihime(井上 織姫)",BleachBleach: Memories in the RainBleach Movie 1: Memories of Nobody,3273,https://myanimelist.net/character/7/Orihime_Inoue,"Blood type: B 
 Height: 5'2"" (157 cm) 
 Weight: 45 kg 
 Birthday: September 3 
 Zodiac: Virgo 
 Theme Song: ""T'en va pas"" by Elsa 
  
 Orihime Inoue has long orange-brown hair which she wears with the bangs behind her ears and hairpins. She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Uryū, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki's shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime. 
  
 Orihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt. 
  
 Orihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime's tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes. 
  
 Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls ""team"" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking ""How do you see yourself in the future?"" when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have. 
  
 Orihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored. 
  
 Orihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive. 
  
 When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.

 Mello is the older of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. When it is decided that Mello should work with the other successor, Near, Mello refuses, citing an inability to work with Near, to whom he is considered second. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is often seen eating bars of chocolate. How to Read 13 states that Mello has ""an excellent mind"" and that he ""sometimes lets his emotions get in his way."" The book cites Mello's ""hatred of Near,"" which created ""a flaw in [Mello's] personality."" The book states that Mello isn't purely evil, citing his apology and genuine care for Matt's well-being. Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of Death Note, stated that Mello ""works hard for everything."" Ohba added that Mello's name ""doesn't really stand for anything,"" as opposed to Near's name standing for Nate River, etc.

She commands a small team of cave raiders known as ""The Layabouts."" Ouzen was a mentor and a close friend of Riko's mother Lyza. 
  
 Ouzen is a peerless fighter—her unique relic ""Thousand Pins"" grants her superhuman strength, speed, and longevity. Even though Ouzen appears to be young, she attained the rank of a white whistle more than 50 years back. She is over two meters tall and has a peculiar hairstyle which conceals the scalp deformations caused by extended exposure to the Curse of the Abyss. 
  
 Ouzen has absolute control over her facial expressions, and her actual feelings (or lack thereof) cannot be guessed with any certainty. The reasons behind her actions are unknown as well—Ouzen rarely bothers to explain herself and, even when she does, it's impossible to know whether she's telling the truth or just toying with the audience.

 Kaoru Hitachiin is a devious and childish first-year student who greatly enjoys toying with his fellow Host Club members, Haruhi and Tamaki (whom he often calls ""My Lord""). He and his older identical twin, Hikaru, are ""little devil"" type hosts who put on an act of ""forbidden brotherly love"" (with Kaoru as the uke) to draw in their clients. Unlike Tamaki, the Hitachiin brothers are wholly calculating in their customer relations; however, this is because of their deep dependency of each other and a reluctance to let anyone into their world. Hikaru and Kaoru share a deep emotional bond, which was forged through a lonely childhood and through the fact that no one could tell them apart without looking at the parting of their hair (Hikaru's hair parts to the right; Kaoru's parts to the left). Since Haruhi is the first person that can truthfully tell them apart, they greatly treasure her friendship. Haruhi has stated that Hikaru and Kaoru have their differences, despite being identical twins. Of the two, Kaoru is nicer, more mature, and considerate of others.",16,,,"175 cm (5'9"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/48469.jpg

He is a delinquent boy who is absent for a long time after getting in a fight early in the story. Despite being a trouble maker, he is a passionate boy who helps others and can achieve high grades with little effort. He does not like going to school because most people see him as a threat and are afraid of him, saddening him as he is unable to make real friends. After meeting Shizuku, he takes her as his first real friend and starts to attend school, falling in love with her in the process. He also keeps a rooster and brings it to school everyday, despite his teacher's disapproval. He has somewhat of a perverted mind, openly saying to Shizuku that he would ""do"" her and has ""dirty thoughts"" about her.

 The wealthy blonde daughter of the school's headteacher, Sena shows a dislike of all things ""ordinary."" She is both attractive and academically successful, but her resulting arrogance leads her to be disliked by her female peers. Their admiration eludes her, much as she desires it; she treats her male classmates only as servants to be used, although many of them would like to be her boyfriend. Nonetheless, she holds Kodaka to a higher standard. Kodaka concludes that she is the weirdest member of the club, as she is able to warrant weird and disgusted looks not only from Yozora and Kobato but also from Yukimura and Rika. 
  
 She enjoys playing video games—including dating sims and eroge—partially because they allow her to make female (if virtual) friends. Yozora calls her ""Meat"" (Niku) an insulting nickname which she secretly likes because it is the first she has ever received. Her father is a friend of Kodaka's father, and pulled strings so that Kodaka could attend St. Chronica's. 
  
 She really likes Kobato, since she always gets really excited when she sees her. Usually, when Sena and Yozora fight, Sena usually runs from the room crying and shouting ""Stupid Yozora! Go die!."" 
  
 It is hinted that she has feelings for Kodaka.",,,,"164 cm (5'3"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/132289.jpg

He grew up like a slave together with his best friend and fellow orphan, Hyō, in a small village, but the two always dreamed of leaving their social class by becoming the world's greatest generals. Not much is known of Xin's family or past. 
  
 Xin has a temper, but he also has a good heart. He is clearly loyal to his friends since he vows to not stop until Hyou's is fully avenged-even at the risk of his own death. His hot temper also makes him clash with Ten and they tend to bicker like siblings constantly! 
  
 Xin's swordsmanship skills are very good due to his constant training over 1000 times with Hyō, but he also has monstrous strength and is very agile. In the fight with Jo Kan, it seems that Shin also has the ability to adapt very quickly in order to get the upper hand in battles. 
  
 Xin dream is to become the world's greatest general, so that his name will be known even in the heavens. He shared this dream with Piao and now sets out to fulfill it for both of them.

 Ami is Yuusaku's childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She is very beautiful and even works as a model, though after she transfers school, she temporarily stops modeling. However, she still continues to go to the gym readily and maintains a slim figure. She is always kind and generous towards others, though this is merely a deception. In truth, she is arrogant and will not hesitate to use others for her own benefit. During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami showed her true colors, but the tables were turned when Taiga threw a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. It's hinted at, mostly through her childhood friend Yuusaku, that she's like this because she hasn't really known any other life than her modeling, which is part of the reason she moved to their hometown to attend school there. 
  
 Which is why, through her affiliations with Taiga and Ryuuji, Ami eventually develops more of a ""middle ground"" personality, signified with her losing her temper and taking out her frustrations on a stalker fan. While this doesn't mean that she automatically become friends with Taiga, the two of them also meet halfway to some extent, thus running into arguments far less frequently. She can still be somewhat manipulative and mischievous, but her ""gravure airhead"" personality is almost entirely abandoned for a more outspoken one, and she's even helped out her newfound friends, including Taiga, on occasion.",,,,165 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/103093.jpg

 Seto Kaiba is the majority shareholder and President of his own multi-national company, KaibaCorp, who aims to become the world's greatest player of the Duel Monsters card game. To accomplish this goal, he must defeat his arch-rival, Yugi Muto. He is largely considered an anti-hero, as his motives are usually ego-centric, but in several cases towards a good cause. 
  
 Kaiba was first introduced as a prodigious, cold-hearted gamer who stopped at nothing to achieve his goals, even resorting to seemingly killing his opponents. He lived a bad childhood because of his good for nothing stepfather. When Kaiba learned that Yugi's grandfather possesses a ""Blue-Eyes White Dragon"" card, he ends up dueling Yami Yugi and lost while ending up in a coma after Yami used his power to momentarily shatter Kaiba's heart to purge it of his evil. Though reformed, later learning his rival's identity to be Atem, Kaiba retains his arrogance and rivalry with Yugi. While Kaiba leaves the story following the Battle City arc, he appears in the anime adaption as a major character and has been mentioned in sequel Yu-Gi-Oh! GX series as the founder of Duel Academy. Among one of the recurring plots in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters is Seto Kaiba being forced to deal with either people adversely affected by Gozaburo Kaiba's actions wanting to take their revenge on Seto Kaiba, or people from within KaibaCorp attempting to take over the corporation. 
  
 He can be condescending, selfish, no-nonsense, and narcissistic, but, as Yami Yugi has said he can be oblivious at times. However, it is stated by Mokuba ever since being adopted by Gozaburo, Kaiba became much colder than he used to be. Despite this, Kaiba still has strong brotherly instincts for Mokuba and will put his life in danger in a heart beat to safeguard Mokuba's life. Apart from Mokuba, Kaiba has compassion for children—especially orphans (as he himself was one and knew what it felt like). Kaiba also threw himself between Zorc and two Egyptian children, thus enabling them to make a getaway. At various points during the series, he opens up momentarily, performing kind acts, though always covering them up with sarcasm, and denying them if asked. These occurrences increase in frequency towards the later series. Aside from that, Kaiba maintains a conservative, stiff, and uptight exterior. Like the Pharaoh, pride is Kaiba's strength and weakness; he never backs down from a fight and gives everything he can in a Duel. This results in his sense of superiority and sense of arrogance, making it extremely difficult to earn his respect, and causes him to look down on and treat others as inferior until they do so. This gives him difficulty when forced to rely on others and work as a team. His pride in himself and his accomplishments is a prominent part of his character throughout the series, and he reacts harshly to those who threaten or infringe on it (although it is toned down slightly towards the end).

644,Lupin III(ルパン三世),Lupin IIILupin III: Alcatraz ConnectionLupin III: Tenshi no Tactics - Yume no Kakera wa Koroshi no Kaori,3173,https://myanimelist.net/character/1044/Lupin_III,"Age: Late 20s - early 30s 
 Birthday: 10 February (The Castle of Cagliostro) 
 Height: 179 cm 
 Weight: 63 kg 
  
 Lupin III is the grandson of Arsène Lupin. He is the world's most wanted thief. Often in his adventures, he takes it upon himself and his gang to foil other criminals engaged in more serious crimes. He sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in jail on several occasions, he has always managed to break out. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his biggest weakness, as it often lands him in undesirable situations. 
  
 In Monkey Punch's original manga, Lupin is cocky, quite crude, and for the most part remorseless. He is very much the ladies' man, often using them for his own gains, and is not beyond forcing himself upon women who resist him. This is in stark contrast to his better-known anime self, who although a skilled thief, occasionally comes off as a chivalrous goofball who enjoys helping those less fortunate than he. Furthermore, Lupin often takes it upon himself and his gang to stop criminals engaged in more violent crimes and leave them for Zenigata to arrest. In the anime, while he fancies himself a Casanova, his actual success with women is erratic, appearing to fluctuate with the writer. 
  
 Even though his gang's loyalty has been an issue, with Fujiko willing to betray and cohort Goemon promising to eventually kill him, Lupin will still drop everything to come to their aid in a helpless moment; further the team would rather face torture than to betray Lupin (or he betray them) to a third party. This rule of loyalty curiously extends as well to Inspector Zenigata, whom Lupin considers a respected friend and opposition. The Inspector reciprocates this regard and out of gratitude has vowed never to attempt to kill Lupin. Lupin's vendetta against the Tarantula Gang in In Memory of the Walther P-38 was partly settling of past betrayal and mostly vengeful payback for their shooting and nearly killing Zenigata. 
  
 It seems Lupin loves to steal more than actually having the treasure he sought. Lupin relishes more in the challenge of stealing and, as long as he succeeds in the heist, is usually not that upset when he ends up empty-handed; there have been times he has lost the object or intentionally thrown it away. There have also been times when Lupin stole an object only to give it to someone else, such as if it rightfully belonged to them or they needed it more than he did. 
  
 When not involved in criminal activities, Lupin usually spends his time dating beautiful girls, fishing, race car driving, attending formal dinners, playing pool, casino gambling, and participating in café society. His favorite foods seem to be mostly French cuisine, sushi, and seafood; when on a job he may settle with ramen noodles. In Lupin the Third Part V, he is shown with an affection for galettes. He also smokes cigarettes and occasionally cigars and kreteks; in the manga, he's seen smoking a briar pipe. His preferred cigarette is the famous French brand Gitanes. Lupin is a celebrated race car driver, competing in several international events when time allows. He's also a skilled sleight of hand artist who loves to befuddle his opponents with various gimmicks: i.e., a cigarette which explodes into confetti, a gun with a spring-loaded boxing glove that clobbers the shooter, and bubble gum that becomes plastique after brief chewing.

 Moka is a student of the Yokai Private Academy. She's the first person Tsukune met when he first set foot on the monster realm. Moka's true form is a vampire but she is very sweet and kind. She takes a liking to Tsukune after sucking his blood and seems to get addicted on doing so. 
  
 The reason Moka wears a rosary around her neck is due to her ""inner self."" When her rosary around her neck is removed (to date Tsukune is the only one capable of removing it), the seal that was keeping her true nature is released. A few physical changes occur, signifying her transformation into a super vampire. Her hair turns silver, her pupils turn to slits, along with a corresponding flash of light. More important than any superficial change, Moka's inner personality rises to the surface. Cold and bloodthirsty, the ""inner"" Moka is actually a completely different entity from the ""outer"" Moka, even going so far as to specifically remind Tsukune to ""be kind to the other Moka."" 
  
 Moka is also one of the most popular girls around the school so she gets a lot of attention around the guys, but she pays them no attention with the exception of Tsukune (much to the guys' dismay). Moka is an excellent student, ranking 13th overall on the school exams, and also a member of the Newspaper Club. Moka is afraid of water, the reason being the purifying powers of water have an adverse effect on Vampires, hurting them as well as rendering them unable to properly function. It's revealed in an omake that she loves tomato juice, but prefers Tsukune's blood.",15-17,,,166 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/78827.jpg

In fact, they can be just as good a puppet master as Lust, but this is overshadowed by their cockiness and bad temper. Their temper can easily be set off by insulting their large and delicate ego, causing them to make mistakes. 
  
  In the 2003 anime series: 
 As the oldest Homunculus, Envy claimed that they had forgotten what they originally looked like. Envy also greatly hates all humans and follows Dante mostly for the opportunity of killing as many people as they could.

 Zodiac sign: Virgo 
 Height: 162 cm 
 Blood type: B 
  
 Also known as Nodame, which is a portmanteau of her family name and the first mora of her given name. Noda is, at the start of the series, a twenty-year-old free-spirited second-year music student. She is depicted as a complete slob: her cooking and cleaning skills are atrocious to the point of having mushrooms growing on her clothes and poisoning anyone who dares to eat her food (yet she's never been poisoned). However she is an incredibly talented pianist who primarily plays by ear, in a cantabile style. In love with Chiaki, she follows him around constantly, claiming to be his ""wife,"" and leans on him to help her get through sticky situations. She sometimes compulsively needs to play the piano, neglecting everything in order to do it. As well as that, she seems to enjoy childish manga and movies. She is constantly hungry, and is fed dinners by Chiaki; she also steals many lunches from her fellow friend, Maki. Nodame has a tendency to speak cryptically (sometimes she doesn't even understand herself), often refers to herself in the third person and uses nonsense words like mukya and gyabo. 
  
 Nodame is initially very dependent on Chiaki in terms of ambition - she has little intention of becoming a professional pianist, despite her remarkable talent, and wants to become a kindergarten teacher, though many feel she is too reckless and lacks the appropriate sensibility to be responsible with teaching children. Her piano style is considered to be completely haphazard, diverting from original intent at both dynamics, rhythms and even themes. Realizing that her current attitude towards music will eventually drive her apart from Chiaki, Nodame gradually develops the necessary drive to pursue music for her own sake. Her attitude towards music is largely due to an incident in the past where she was hurt by a teacher who demanded her to play music ""as it's written."" 
  
 Nodame's character is based on a real-life counterpart with same name.

 Hasegawa used to be an official working for the Bakufu, but after an unfortunate incident with Amanto dignitary Prince Hata, whom he was assigned to serve and protect, his superior asked him to succumb to his shame and commit seppuku, hearing that he ran away from his quarters. 
  
 He initially believed that humans should focus on appeasing the Amanto, but after his encounter with Gintoki, his mindset changed, which led to him punching Hata out, thus getting fired. Since then, he has been living a life of somewhat like a loser, getting fired almost every time he gets a new job, mostly due to the unfavourable look his sunglasses and goatee give him. 
  
 No matter what, he refuses to remove his sunglasses because it's the only thing he had left to remind him of his successful past. Although he does exchange the sunglasses for a decent pair of half-moon spectacles at one point, he goes back to wearing them after he decides that he is going to live out his life in the best way he can. He is constantly seen working various part-time jobs. He is often referred to as ""Madao,"" short for ""marude damena ossan,"" which roughly translates into ""totally useless middle-aged man."" 
  
 He and Gintoki are on good terms with one another and seem to spend most of their free time gambling. He often plays pachinko, but rarely ever wins. After losing his job for the Bakufu, he is seen doing odd jobs from time to time, like running a supermarket for a friend or driving a taxi at one time. 
  
 He's currently estranged from his wife Hatsu, because of his jobless lifestyle, however they still keep in touch. 
  
 It is revealed in episode 52 that he is 38 years old after he pees his pants.

He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes. 
  
 He obtained the job of ""Synergist"" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today. 
  
 Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation. 
  
 Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies. 
  
 His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called ""Predator."" He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.

 Lives in: Washimiya, Saitama Prefecture

 Kagami is the older fraternal twin sister of Tsukasa. In school, her grades are excellent and she studies very hard. She was even the class president of her class in her first year. She is in a different class than Konata and Tsukasa, but she frequently comes to their class during lunch time to eat with them. Additionally, Kagami chose the humanities course in her second year so that she could be with Konata, but she was the only one separated into a different classroom; the same occurred in her third year. Kagami, seldom referred to as ""Kagamin,"" is a bit egotistical and is not a good cook. 
  
 Kagami's physique is average. She has long light purple hair, wears a ribbon tied into pig-tails, and her sharp eyes are light violet. Kagami is the stereotypical ""tsukkomi"" character, however, she is prone to become shy at times, hence being a tsundere character as well. 
  
 Much like Konata, Kagami likes video games, but plays a different genre than Konata: Kagami likes to play scrolling shooters. She loves to read light novels, but she feels lonely at times because no one around her has the same interest as her.

Though he says he's in love with her, he has no idea how to deal with girls, as he shows no sign of arousal around Togame when she's naked, and doesn't even realize he's supposed to praise her when she wears new clothes. However, this allows Togame to be very open with him, which is an advantage to their quest of collecting the twelve deviant swords.

664,Balalaika(バラライカ),Black Lagoon OmakeBlack LagoonBlack Lagoon: The Second Barrage,3009,https://myanimelist.net/character/461/Balalaika,"Balalaika is the boss of Hotel Moscow. Her real name is Sofiya Pavlovna. She was brought up by her grandfather, the military head of the USSR. Before joining the mafia, Balalaika was a captain in the Soviet Army and a Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska paratrooper who served in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. A fine marksman and sniper, she was nicknamed ""balalaika"", one of the Soviet Army's slang terms for the Dragunov sniper rifle. Due to Balalaika's leadership during the hellish fighting in Afghanistan, her men look up to her as their superior and will do just about anything upon her orders. As a combat officer, she is a skilled strategist and well-rounded fighter, capable of taking care of herself despite the fact that all of her troopers, including Boris, often worry about her. Although she has shown herself to be rather cynical on occasion, she is also a pragmatic and professional businesswoman. She frequently employs Dutch and the Lagoon Company, apparently because they share a mutual respect. 
  
 Balalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname ""Fry-Face"" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a military greatcoat, thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes cigars, in contrast with the other characters who smoke cigarettes. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she is between 31–35 years old. She is one of the few people to earn Revy's respect. In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills. 
  
 In critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and Spetsnaz commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the Desantniki, they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship Maria Zeleska as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the Interpol list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by diplomatic immunity.

 He's really bad at studying and always get low grades even in English (even though he's a returnee!). He's unexpectedly good at cooking, since he lives alone, and he also has an enormous appetite, which is shown when he orders tons of burgers. In the past, he was attacked by a dog, and that made him afraid of dogs until now (but later on he's able to deal with Tetsu No. 2, Seirin's pet dog).

683,Kenshirou(ケンシロウ),Hokuto no KenHokuto no Ken 2Shin Hokuto no Ken,2926,https://myanimelist.net/character/2511/Kenshirou,"Kenshirou (Ken for short) is the 64th successor of the ""Hokuto Shin Ken"" style. He has seven scars on his chest in the shape of the ""Hokuto Shichisei,"" or Big Dipper, that were put there by Shin 
  
 A strong and mostly stoic character, Kenshirou is compelled to punish evil-doers and can perform feats not possible for most people. His mastery of the ancient martial art Hokuto Shinken allows him to kill or cripple with a mere touch. The results tend to be very messy -it usually causes parts of the victim to explode- but the art also includes several other means of killing. He can also use this art to heal or to alter people's behavior. Later in the series Kenshirou learns parts of other martial arts. 
  
 When angry his spiritual powers reach their peak, normally culminating in the dramatic destruction of his shirt and jacket (which, despite the obvious lack of a wardrobe or clothing store, are always replaced in the next episode or story arc) to expose his muscular torso. 
  
 His catchphrase is Omae wa mō shindeiru (おまえはもう死んでいる), meaning ""You are already dead,"" which he usually says before a villain's head is about to explode. 
  
 After surviving the nuclear war, he tries to live in peace with his fiancee Yuria, until Jagi instigates Shin, a jealous rival from the Nanto Seiken school, to challenge, then defeat Kenshirou. Shin then engraves the iconic seven scars on Kenshirou's chest and leaves him for dead. Prior to this event he was more forgiving of his enemies, as shown in a flashback of Jagi's failed assassination attempt against him, in which Kenshirou chooses to spare Jagi's life after defeating him rather than end it. When Kenshirou later fights his old rivals in the present, particularly Shin, Jagi, and Raoh, they all remark on Kenshirou's acquired mercilessness. 
  
 The initial story arc centers around Kenshirou's quest to reclaim Yuria from Shin. In the very first chapter, he meets a pair of orphans who follows him in his journey: Bat, a thief; and Lin, a young girl rescued by Ken. Through the course of the series, Kenshirou protects the weak and innocent from the numerous gangs roaming the post-apocalyptic wasteland, eventually gaining his reputation as the ""Savior of the Century's End."" Kenshirou's skills improve through his encounters with members of the Nanto Roku Seiken and his Hokuto Brothers. 
  
 Although still emotionally repressed and stoic like most male heroes in 1980's media, Kenshirou is notable in anime culture for being a sensitive and kind-hearted man who broke the then-ironclad ""men don't cry"" cultural expectation. He is famous for openly shedding tears, if not outright weeping for the suffering of innocents and the deaths of his few noble enemies. This trait is unfortunately downplayed in the 1980's anime adaptations, but comes back into the franchise in the adaptations of the 1990s and onward.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/286109.jpg

 Birthplace: Man-Home 
 Height: 155 cm 
 Blood type: A 
  
 A native of Man-Home, Akari is a happy and easy-going person, who we rarely see angry or upset, a quality which she shares with her supervisor. She is best described as a romantic, and seems to find enjoyment in things or events that other people might think humdrum and mundane. Akari often says ""Hohe"" or ""Hahi,"" which is her short version of ""wow."" 
  
 While she is not quite as skilled in rowing as Alice, nor is as familiar with the history of the city as Aika, her carefree and laid-back manner often endears her to the many people she encounters. As such, she seems to make friends very easily, and can hold a warm conversation even with complete strangers, a fact that causes her to be labeled as ""mysterious"" by her closest friends Aika and Alice. She also accidentally learned how to row backwards on the gondola back when she was at Man-Home, which Aika states, ""Akari is almost invincible when she rows backwards"" (from the anime and the manga). She is frequently writing letters about her adventures on Aqua to an unnamed person back on Man-home (revealed in the last chapter of the manga); in the anime, these letters are directed to Ai.",15,,,155 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/322412.jpg

 He develops an intense attachment to swords and fencing at an early age, possessing an almost preternatural ability to react to his opponents' moves. 
  
 Kojirou is deaf and mute, though still literate. His personality is very playful, almost child-like. Ittousai has also commented on the possibility that Kojirou's eyes have become better developed to compensate for his lack of hearing. 
  
 Kojirou is renowned for his ""Tsubame Gaeshi"" (Turning Swallow Cut) technique, inspired by the movement of a swallow in flight.

She is also shown to be very jealous to the point of obsession whenever Kyotaro interacts with other girls.

 Sagiri was taught to draw by her mother at a young age, and by the time she was around the age of nine, she became Masamune's illustrator. A year before the events of the novel, Sagiri met Masamune, though she didn't realize that he was the author she was working with despite the similar names. After her mother died, she temporarily stopped drawing and going outside. After seeing a live video of someone drawing images and getting a response, Sagiri became interested in live video feeds and started drawing images on a camera disguising her face and voice so that nobody would recognize her or learn about her. She eventually started to interact with people who saw her video feed (while still disguised). At some point, Masamune was too busy to cook and she chose to go hungry rather than go outside her room to get food.

He lost his best friend in war who requested him to take care of his family. After returning home once his enlistment term in the army was over, he set out to pan gold in Hokkaido in order to earn enough money to fulfill his friend's last wish. There he met a man who told him a tale of lost gold treasure which once belonged to a people known as the 'Ainu'. He also told him that the man who hid it was later imprisoned and he left clues to find the treasure on the skin of his fellow inmates. 
  
 Sugimoto is a strong and skilled warrior and soldier with instincts needed to survive. He even succeeds to overpower and kill a rogue bear with his knife and bayonet. Although fierce on battlefield and having blood on his hands, he is not cruel and unkind. He is valorous and kind. He later reveals on being asked why he is called 'Immortal Sugimoto' that he learned the only way to live is, not to be killed and so he only kills to protect his own life. 
  
 He has two scars on his face which are perpendicular and runs across his whole visage, while the third deviates from the horizontal one like a tree branch. His whole body is also covered in scars earned in battle. 
  
 Year round, Sugimoto wears a kimono with the sleeves tied up by a tasuki and the back hem tucked in shirihashori style over a mandarin collar shirt. He also wears the military cap, trousers, and high boots that were part of his uniform during the Russo-Japanese War. In colder weather, he also wears a dark blue trench coat and a foreign made scarf.

 Age: 16 
 Height: 165cm 
 Weight: 50.5kg 
 Size: 89 - 57 - 87 
 Zodiac sign: Cancer 
  
 Princess of Deviluke. Ran away from home so she doesn't have to get married. Uses many self-made inventions. At first she was pretending to love Rito to keep from getting married, but eventually she fell in love with him. She has physical abilities far beyond that of a human and also has a distinctive tail coming from her back (which is very sensitive). 
  
 Being an alien, Lala has far more strength, power and speed than the average human. Her physical strength (without any inventions or powers) surpasses any human on Earth, and maybe even some aliens in the solar system. She has also shown slight durability even with her own tongue, like when she ate one of Run's really spicy sandwiches and it didn't even phase her. 
  
 She can fire laser beams from her tail. However, her tail is both her weapon and her weakness. On Planet Deviluke, females' tails are far more sensitive than males'. When someone touches Lala's tail, she becomes weak and seems to lose her strength, though she can shake anyone off of her tail with her astonishing strength. 
  
 Perhaps Lala's most distinguishing ability is being an extraordinary inventor. She is considered a genius and has made many inventions; however, Lala very much has the personality of both a perky child and an absent-minded scientist, resulting in all of her inventions being very toy-like, troublesome, and serving no important purpose besides fun, mischief, and unintentional fanservice. A running gag in the plot is that her inventions usually do not work as well as Lala and the others had hoped, often resulting into a perverted accident.

Although seemingly emotionless and mute, it is shown that she cares deeply about her friends and other people, even Ayumu though she considers him to be her servant.

 He is a very calm and serious person who is convinced that he has no feelings. Therefore, he behaves monotonously and only talks when it is necessary. However, his true personality is revealed when he is alone with his wife. You can tell that he is very shy in front of her and that's why she can easily tease him. His wife is the only person he deeply trusts and cares about because he is madly in love with her. 
  
 He is known as Gabimaru the Hollow, mostly because he kills his victim within seconds without feeling guilty nor showing mercy. In fact, he was born to kill. 
  
 In conclusion, he was arranged and agreed because he saw it as an order. Later he met his wife, who taught him that he is not empty and just buries his feelings deep inside him. It is also shown that Gabimaru is suicidal but ultimately regains his will to live because he wants to meet his wife.

She is bold and determined to help others regardless of the cost. It is because of her that Inuyasha is able to make more friends. Her kind heart and beauty results in several men falling in love with her throughout their journey. 
  
 InuYasha wears a special bead necklace (known as the Beads of Subjugation) which only responds to Kagome's command: when she yells ""Sit!"" (""Osuwari!"") (Often ""Sit, boy!"" in the dub) InuYasha is thrown to the ground. The necklace was placed upon him due to his dangerous attitude when he was unsealed.

 Blood type: A 
 Height: 170 cm 
 Russian name: Алиса Михайловна Кудзё 
  
 Alisa is a beautiful and talented first-year student who is popular for her looks and cold attitude. She was born to a Russian father and a Japanese mother. She occasionally makes remarks in Russian, which confuse her teacher and her classmates. Though she is popular and attracts the attention of many boys and girls at school, because of her cold demeanour, Alisa doesn't have many friends and isn't very experienced at social interaction, though that slowly changes the more she spends time with her classmate Masachika. She disapproves of Masachika's lack of motivation, but at the same time, she seems to be in love with him, and constantly flirts with him in Russian. She is Maria's younger sister. She spent part of her life in Vladivostok, where she had difficulties making friends. She is the Student Council Treasurer, and is running for the next Student Council as the proposed President, with Masachika being the Vice-President. 
  
 Her cold attitude could be rooted to her experiences in Vladivostok. One time, when she was doing a project work with her groupmates, she realised that her groupmates were too lazy to start working early. Her groupmates, however, then quarrelled with Alisa since she was working too hard. The project work later came as a failure, so she decided to work hard on her own and avoid working with others, leading to her cold attitude. 
  
 She likes to eat sweet food, and is afraid of eating spicy food.

He has been training in martial arts since the age of three, and has trained under various teachers and coaches throughout his life. At the age of thirteen, he decided to take his training into his own hands and left the coaches to perform more intense training ""in his father's footsteps."" He later meets with his father and becomes disillusioned as to his father's true character, and afterwards, aims to defeat and kill him. His fighting style is called ""Total Fighting"" and includes techniques from many different martial arts. He fights Arudi Regan in round 1, Zool in round 2, Igari Kanji in round 3, and Retsu Kaioh in round 4 before facing his brother in round 5 which are the finals of the tournament. He eventually develops the ogre/demon face on his back when fighting his brother, but manages to suppress it. 
  
 Unlike Yuujirou, he chooses to control his killing intent and fight his battles fair and honorably no matter what the outcome. Many of Baki's unusual training methods often earn him the admiration of many of the fighters of the underground arena for example Shadowboxing, or visualizing fighting an opponent, is a big part of Baki's regimen sometimes his visions take an almost corporeal form and given he can easily remember and replicate any technique he sees this gives him a huge edge over his opponents as he can fight them and learn their weakness' before actually fighting them. Baki has encounters with all the escaped convicts in the 'Search of Our Strongest Hero' series, has just defeated Biscuit Oliva, and is now faced with a new challenge against the prehistoric man Pickle. He is currently waiting for his fight with Pickle after Retsu and Katsumi are defeated. He had a shadow boxing visualization fight with a T-Rex prior to the Katsumi/Pickle fight. He has been recently defeated by Pickle in the Korakuen area.

 Current Concern: ""I want my physical power level a bit higher."" 
 Ability Parameters (out of 5): power = 3; jump = 4; stamina = 4; intellect = 4; technique = 4; speed = 4 
  
 Keiji Akaashi is a second year at Fukurōdani Academy, and he is the volleyball team's vice captain and setter. 
  
 Akaashi seems calm and composed most of the time, and doesn't show a wide range of emotions. He tends to call people out on the foolish things they do, especially Bokuto, who he seems to be relatively close with despite their opposite personalities. 
  
 Akaashi is blunt with the things he says and often invites himself into the conversation when necessary, throwing in witty comments or responses. He is also quite polite and humble but, this could be due to the fact that he is younger than most of his teammates, as he does have a cheeky side, dubbing Kuroo during one match: Pain-in-the-ass Kuroo-san. 
 He is also humble, knowing his own limits in his setting abilities as he pointed out he couldn't have done what Kageyama could.

 She is the love interest of both André Grandier, her servant at the Jarjayes mansion and afterwards a soldier in her regiment, and Marie Antoinette, who she acts as a bodyguard to. She also earns the admiration and love of Rosalie Lamorlière, and in turn calls Rosalie her ""spring breeze."" Other women are infatuated with Oscar, even after she tells them she is female. She dislikes the court intrigues, but remains there out of loyalty to her father and her friend, Marie Antoinette.

Ever since her cousin Erina told Alice her cooking was terrible when they were children, Alice's goal has been to become a top class chef and surpass Erina and her God Tongue.  Before moving back to Japan to attend Tootsuki, she lived in Denmark with her family and began her focus on molecular gastronomy.  As a result, her cooking is based on combining modern tools with the most advanced theories in order to deliver the best dishes she possibly can. 
  
 Alice has short silver hair with a left bang that is longer than the rest of her hair.  She has fair skin and red eyes and tends to wear the beige Tootsuki vest uniform instead of the standard school uniform, and her cooking uniform is a short-sleeved chef's uniform with red accents on her cuffs and collar. 
  
 Alice has a very demanding personality that seems to emphasize her Nakiri upbringing.  She's bossy and pushy, and will do what it takes to get her way, utilizing not only her personality but also her incredibly advanced cunning and wit. As a result, she absolutely hates to lose; an example here is the fact that—not wanting to be outdone by Erina— once she saw that Erina had an aid called Hisako Arato, she in turn forcefully made Kurokiba Ryo join her as an aid. When not competing, though, Alice is extremely friendly and talkative. She loves to prod and make fun of people during conversations, but will pout to no end when she wants or needs something or thinks something has happened to make her look worse.

In battle, Thorkell typically wields a pair of axes as his primary weapons, but his greatest asset is probably his vast physical strength. During a skirmish with Askeladd's band, he hurled a spear with such force that it skewered three man at once, despite having been thrown from several hundred feet away. Thorkell's character is based on Thorkell the Tall, a historical Jomsviking lord who is a mentor to Canute in the Flateyjarbók.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/437129.jpg

 A calligrapher who disgraced himself by punching a director of an art gallery who criticized his calligraphy style heavily as ""boring,"" ""rigid,"" ""academic,"" and ""bland."" He then leaves for the Goto Islands in Nagasaki at the suggestion of his famous calligrapher father to focus more on his calligraphy as he waits out his ""exile."" Along the way, he finds value in interactions with other people, in particular a tomboyish little girl named Naru, and finds his inspiration and own personal style. 
  
 At first, Naru calls him ""Junon Boy,"" referring to a particular magazine that features street pictures of male idols, suggesting (incorrectly) that he's a city-dwelling pretty boy of the kind that don't really exist in real life. Later on, she calls him, ""Sensei."" 
  
 Sei Handa appears again in another manga titled Handa-kun , a prequel of sorts featuring Handa during his high school years. In the prequel, he is a well-regarded school idol and prodigy calligrapher who holds the hilariously mistaken belief that no one likes him and that the distantly worshipful actions of his peers is in fact bullying. This is apparently the fault of his best friend of both series, Kawafuji, who told him a lie that he was ""hated"" as a joke, which Handa mistook for the truth, and his friend never actually tried to correct because he found it funny and amusing.",23,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/510429.jpg

 Nozomi is Eri's best friend and the vice president of the school's student council. She often advises μ's and appears as wise. However, because of the way she punishes them (by grabbing their breasts), she often seems perverted. Despite this, she is the eldest member of μ's. 
  
 She likes spiritual things such as ""power spots"" and charms, though she is most well known for her fortune-telling which she uses as her secret method of quickly fitting in whenever she is forced to change environments. She also finds an interest in helping the other girls as much as possible. She was Otonokizaka High School's student council vice-president. It is also stated that she likes taking naps.

 Gokudera was born in Italy and is 3/4 Italian and 1/4 (mother) Japanese. His blood type is B, is 168 cm tall, weighs 54kg and his hair is silver. His future dream is to become the Tsuna's right-hand man. He has an ability to play the piano. He dislikes people that are older than him, Bianchi and Lambo. Gokudera is also a chain smoker, but they remove this in the anime adaptation. 
  
 At school, Hayato is adored by many of the female classmates who view him as the ""rebellious badboy."" During Valentine's Day, a large group of females constantly followed him around trying to give him chocolate, although Hayato seemed to be more annoyed than flattered by this. Despite his image of a rebel, Hayato excels in his schoolwork and aces all his tests, much to the surprise of Tsuna. This is probably due to his rich upbringing, suggesting that he probably had a multitude of private tutors when he was young. He idolizes Tsuna greatly and considers himself to be Tsuna's right-hand man. 
  
 Due to a traumatic childhood experience, every time he sees the face of his older sister, Bianchi, he becomes sick, sometimes even falling unconscious. Oddly enough, he is immune to his sister when she happens to be wearing something that covers part of her face (i.e. glasses or goggles).",13-15; 23-25,,Japanese/Italian,168.5 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/61975.jpg

 Hidenori Tabata is a second-year high school student of the Prefectural Sanada North High School and a member of its Handicrafts Club. He is in Class 2-A. He wears eyeglasses even though he has normal visual acuity. Hidenori serves as the main trio’s leader, always the one coming up with the wild ideas and crazy antics. He can actually perceive something as ridiculous but since he claims to be an entertainer, he tries to make the best of it. Despite appearing stoic, he has a tendency of overthinking simple situations and getting bored quite quickly. Still, Hidenori is shown to have a strong magnetic personality. 
  
 For one, thanks to his profound speech, Hidenori became Yassan’s center of attention after she saw his similarity to the protagonist of her novel who has the power of the wind. Ever since then, he became morbidly frightened of her, trying to avoid meeting her at all cost, until a failed attempt to impress Yanagi made him realize Yassan’s appreciation of him. 
  
 When he was younger, Hidenori got bullied a lot until Rubber Shooter showed up and saved him. He then began idolizing him and placing him in high regard till he suspected Yoshitake as the masked hero. In spite of his admittance that he finds the smallest things about Yoshitake annoying, he still appreciates what he does for him. 
  
 Hidenori has an older brother named Yuusuke who used to be the ringleader of the group before he graduated high school, a cousin named Emi who spent a summer vacation with him, and an unnamed father who calls him Megane and laughs at his dreams. He has known Tadakuni and Yoshitake since middle school.

Unfortunately, even with her neat skills in cooking, Megumi's poor social skills and her extreme demophobia got the best of her and had to rely on someone who is close to her possibly due to her humble status and her ordinary beginnings in the academy. However, after witnessing Souma's incredible cooking skills and creative method of cooking, Megumi would become his assistant, partner, and friend throughout the series. 
  
 Easily nervous and sensitive, Megumi is one of the clumsy and shy students who tries to do her best while continuing to become a chef. She easily panics whenever accidents (some are usually in a comedic fashion) happen or when other students almost finish their work. She is also a rather cautious student who uses her words carefully to avoid unwanted consequences. It is revealed later that Megumi actually fears the crowd, which the crowd made her nervous even until the extent of her lacking confidence, might be the reason for her to have barely survived passing in the academy, even with her good skills in cooking. With her demophobia, Megumi's skills were remained hindered despite her knowledge of recipe and some cooking methods. 
  
 Despite her weakness, Megumi is an honest and innocent student who does not lie about anything. She has a strong determination and will try her best to reach her dream to become a chef after she is paired with Souma. She also values friendship and rather observant towards any cooking style available in order for her to learn the style fast (especially Souma's). 
  
 Megumi's style of cooking is mostly based on cutting the ingredients using neat style. With her neat style of cutting, most of her cuts are considered artistic as well as well prepared. Due to her fear of crowds, the true nature of her cooking is often hindered. Megumi's careful cutting and wise use of every material made her an unexpected expert, even if it took more time for her to specify the chemistry of the ingredients for the dish. Also, despite her lack of confidence and also her fear of crowds, Megumi's strong observation made her create a dish to even supposed rivaled to Souma and other professional should she stay optimistic. With her being an assistant chef beside Souma since her seemly last class at Chapple class, Megumi seemingly adopted Souma's creativity through her observation from Souma's cooking.

In the manga(chp.1) he says he never lost a fight until he met Yusuke. He leads a gang consisting of himself, Kirishima, Okubo, and Sawamura (In the English dub, Komada). He has a soft spot for kittens (including his own, Eikichi) and an iron code of honor. He develops a minor crush on Botan when he first meets her, but later harbors intense feelings on the ice apparition Yukina, but is unaware that she is Hiei's sister. 
  
 Kuwabara has a tough older sister named Shizuru Kuwabara. She and Yukina are the only characters known to call him by his given name. In the anime, Kazuma and Shizuru's parents never appear and are rarely, if ever, even acknowledged. His father does makes a brief appearance in the final volume of the manga to reveal that Yukina is going to be living with them and appears to be aware of the Reikai, etc. As the show progress, Kuwabara's and Yusuke's relationship evolves from rivals to best friends, although the two still disagree constantly. Kuwabara and Kurama are quite cordial with each other, but Kuwabara shares no love for Hiei, and both will readily mention their hatred of the other, although in truth deep down they are friends. 
  
 Kuwabara's most unusual ability is his sensitivity to Reiki, or Spirit Awareness. He and his band of friends call this ""the Tickle."" Kuwabara has the ability to sense when ghosts and the paranormal are around, can see spirits and other demons, and can predict motives of others. Kuwabara can also create a blade out of his own spirit energy (known as the Rei Ken, or Spirit Sword). Although he first needed a piece of wood as a physical entity to create it, Kuwabara was able to practice and be able to create his own after one month (six months in the English anime). During his training, Kuwabara's sword is able to extend and shrink to his whim, and he can even create two, one in each hand. 
  
 Kuwabara, unlike the rest of his teammates, can be reckless, but is extremely loyal to his friends and has a very strict code of honor. He would do anything for his friends and for love but can be quite crafty in battle when he needs to be, and he is widely considered as the nicest of the four.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/96678.jpg

 In the story, Bam enters The Tower in search of his best friend Rachel, the only person who visited him and cared for him in the years of isolation that he spent in a cave underneath the Tower. After entering the Tower, he is told that all the answers that he seeks will be answered if he climbs the tower, though he is immediately presented with a seemingly impossible and deadly test.

 Shuu Tsukiyama is the infamous Gourmet ghoul. He is a fourth-year student studying Social Welfare at the Department of Human Sciences at Haruna Gakuin University. 
  
 An eccentric man with opulent taste, his act as a gentleman and an intellectual, serves as a facade to hide a disturbed and narcissistic nature. As a ghoul, he displays his arrogance as a strong predator that seeks to devour the finest meals he makes of his 'prey,' so as to proclaim himself the top carnivore of the food chain. His interest in European literature and language is shown in his gestures and mannerisms, often peppering his dialog with borrowed English, French, and Italian. He shows great anger towards others who disrespect his taste in food; shattering a teacup in front of Kaneki during their date at the coffee shop when he remembered his encounter with Rize. Rize, while working at his Gourmet Club, believed that his picky eating habits made him seem more like a human than a ghoul, the worst sort of insult he could have received, and therefore Shuu bears grudges over Rize, calling her a 'pig' for ridiculing his taste for food.",20-21,,,180 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/296873.jpg

 Birthday: March 27 (Aries) 
 Height: 145 cm 
 Blood type: O 
 Class: 2-A 
 Hobbies: collecting ribbons 
  
 Chiyo is a bright, cheerful and excitable young girl. She has been shown to be very easily influenced, often letting her imagination go wild. For example, she became excited when Mikoshiba first introduced her to Kashima and hugely misjudged their relationship. Chiyo has also been shown, for the most part, to be able to get along with others. Although she is often surprised, and sometimes even annoyed, by many of her friends' odd personalities and antics, she is friendly to them regardless. For instance, even though Yuzuki Seo is often rude to people, she still managed to be friends with her. This may be partly due to her slight naïveté, however, she often cannot tell why people are annoyed by Yuzuki. Outside of school, Chiyo is also passionate about drawing, as she is a member of the Arts club and enjoys helping out Nozaki with his manga. Her art style is very classical and has a lot of detail. 
  
 Chiyo constantly struggles to convey her feelings to her crush Nozaki. Usually jovial, Chiyo is often irked and depressed by her failed attempts to improve her relationship with Nozaki. In her first effort to confess to him he mistakenly misinterpreted her confession as declaring herself as one of his fans much to her dismay. Since helping his mangaka work as an assistant, she has continued her attempts at winning his affection although her endeavors are often fruitless due to a mixture of bad luck and Nozaki's ironic lack of romanticism. Nevertheless, she does not give up and continues to work hard, something that has constantly concerned others about her borderline fixation on Nozaki.

 From his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru's goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories. 
  
 He was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru's natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru's personality. 
  
 Orochimaru's desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world. 
  
 After leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi's body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan.",50-51 (I); 54 (II),,,179.4 cm (Part I); 172.0 cm (Part II),,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/3/162089.jpg

She also never remembers to knock before entering the Service Club's classroom, much to Yukino's chagrin.

Chousou initially sided with Kenjaku's alliance with Mahito until he discovered one of the curse user's past identities was the cruel father of the Death Painting Wombs, Noritoshi Kamo. He also found out that Yuji Itadori is another relative of Kenjaku's and has aligned himself with his new ""younger brother."" 
  
 As a Death Painting Womb, Chousou is a half-human, half-cursed spirit who has a flesh and blood body that is fully visible even to non-sorcerers. His appearance is predominantly that of a human man with long black stringy hair tied into two high ponytails that jut upward and outward. Chousou has small dark purple eyes with slightly thin eyebrows and a blood mark that extends from both sides of his face across the bridge of his nose. He can make this mark bleed at will in order to produce ammunition for his cursed technique, and the mark changes shape if he uses Flowing Red Scale. 
  
 As far as clothing, Chousou wears a loose, light tan robe that covers his torso, arms, and legs. It's worn underneath a purple gi-like vest that covers his torso in a ""v"" shape and has a bottom section that extends to Chousou's waist and groin area. He also always sports a round scarf around his neck that matches his gi and brown boots. 
  
 In the anime, Chousou has violet eyeshadow around his eyes and his hair is a light brown color.

783,Black★Rock Shooter(ブラック★ロックシューター),Black★Rock Shooter (OVA)Black★Rock Shooter (TV)Black★Rock Shooter,2489,https://myanimelist.net/character/19706/Black★Rock_Shooter,"Height: 158 cm 
  
 Black★Rock Shooter is the titular character and main protagonist of many projects, including the anime OVA Black★Rock Shooter, the RPG of the same name, the anime series and the manga Black★Rock Shooter ~Innocent Soul~. She was an original design of Hatsune Miku, created by huke who participated in the release of the song ""Black★Rock Shooter"" by supercell. 
  
  
 Character Design: 
 Black★Rock Shooter's original design is of a pale-skinned, blue-eyed girl, with black hair in uneven twintails; the right lock of her hair is shorter than her left. She bears two scars on her midriff. A blue flame shoots out from her left eye. 
  
 Her clothes consist of a string bikini top under a black jacket. The jacket has a white stripe running along the length of each of her sleeves and has a white star design on the front (left side) and back. She also wears a pair of tight-fitting shorts, gloves, and black knee-high boots. 
  
 Her weapons consist of a black-hilted katana later named as Black Blade and a large gun called ★rock Cannon. She is the ""other self"" of Mato in the other world. 
  
 OVA: 
 A shot of Black★Rock Shooter from the OVA, showing her signature blue flame. The OVA adaptation added some details to Black★Rock Shooter. Unlike in her original design, her eyes have a concentric circle pattern, a trait she shares with other characters in the OVA. 
 Black★Rock Shooter is also given a personality in the OVA. She is depicted as a calm and collected girl, not speaking at all until her confrontation with Mato, near the end of the OVA. She also does not focus on anything except the most important thing she has to do at the moment. 
  
 She is shown to be very skilled in fighting, despite being quickly taken down by Black★Gold Saw in her first shown battle. Black★Rock Shooter is able to fight evenly with Dead Master, despite appearing to try not to hurt her. 
  
  
 Anime Adaptation: 
 Black★Rock Shooter has been redesigned for the anime, with some new elements possibly inspired by the designs of White Rock Shooter and Black★Rock Shooter Beast, as her new jacket and boots (which are now more blue than black) have similarities to both WRS' and B★RSB's clothing. Like her hairstyle in the PSP game, her hairstyle is spikier compared to her OVA appearance. She no longer has any scar on her midriff. She wears her trademark hood more often than she does in other media. Black★Rock Shooter in the anime seems to be more brutal than any other B★RS incarnation, having beheaded Chariot and Arata's possible other self, and killed Dead Master.

She allows Hayate to call her by her first name and also seems to be infatuated by Hayate and his attractive personality. 
  
 Hinagiku is sometimes referred to as being rather masculine for a girl by other characters in the series. Miki suggests this is because Hinagiku is seen as being ""cooler"" than the boys, and the fact that she was rather domineering at a younger age. Her athleticism, competitiveness, and leadership position all also probably contribute to this view.

 Karma: Negative 450 (Very~Extremely Evil) 
 Creator: Peroroncino 
  
 Shalltear is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino. 
  
 Shalltear has a very flirtatious personality and is very open with her sexual preferences, often to other characters' discomfort. Despite her apparent shamelessness, she can be quite innocent about certain things. She has a complex about her small figure, which she attempts to cover up by using breast pads. 
  
 As a true vampire, Shalltear is extremely proud and takes her position as a Floor Guardian very seriously. She has no patience for failure and will often burst into fits of rage at signs of an unfavorable situation. She will not hesitate to kill any servant who disappoints her; however, she will not punish others for failing in tasks that are impossible to begin with. 
  
 Shalltear is completely loyal to Momonga and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn't go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.

 Species: Shark/Cat Beastmen 
 Occupation: Vice Commander/Warrior/Team Dai-Gurren Member 
 Relationships: Kamina (rival), Simon (rival/ally), Thymilph (superior officer), Adiane (superior officer), Cytomander (superior officer), Lord Genome (king) 
 Gunmen: Enki, Enkidu, Dai-Gunkai (temporarily), Enkidudu, Gurren, Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, Enkidududu (drama cd), Enkidudududu (drama cd), Dai-Gunzankai (drama cd), Tengen Toppa Enki Dulga (Lagann-hen) 
  
 Viral is a recurring enemy and later an important ally to Team Dai-Gurren in the japanese anime Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki's helmet in the fight. 
  
 Viral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren's capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph's demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren's foot from crushing her. After Adiane's death by the Dai-Gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor. 
  
 Under Supreme General Cytomander's command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander's aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King's permission to execute him for treason, but Viral's last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen's existance before making him immortal. Viral's last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without ""Spiral Energy"" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.",,,,,Vice Commander/Warrior/Team Dai-Gurren Member,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/153853.jpg

 Gakuto is a calculating and intelligent person, though relatively lacking in his studies. He is thus the mastermind behind a lot of the organized breakouts in the prison along with Kiyoshi Fujino.

 Aerosmith is an airplane-like stand, equipped with machine guns and missiles to attack enemies. It uses a radar to detect an enemy's position. Its radar detects only CO2, which makes it a problem when there is a big crowd. 
  
 Like Bruno, Narancia delivers his finishing line in segments. He'll say, ""Vola, vola, vola..."" during his rapid-fire attack and end with, ""Volare Via!"" (Italian for ""Fly Away"") when he finishes. 
  
 His education does not extend past elementary school, a fact that he gets angers him when people mention it. His favorite TV show is the anime Fist of the North Star .

 Arcueid Brunestud is the White Princess of the True Ancestors. The title of Brunestud was given to those True Ancestors capable of manifesting the Millennium Castle Brunestud, and has been likened to be the vampire royal family, although this is not strictly true. The True Ancestors were a race of beings copied from TYPE-MOON, the ultimate being of the moon, also known as the Crimson Moon. Long ago the planet had no defense mechanism against humanity, nothing to keep them in check. Thus the Crimson Moon came down and offered to help the planet make a race of ultimate beings to rule over humanity, thus resulting in them being the 'consciousness of the planet.' True Ancestors are likened to occurrences such as earthquakes and typhoons rather than individuals as their ""...actions, while evil and without justification, would come as naturally to her (Arcueid and other True Ancestors) as breathing."" However the race was fundamentally flawed, they had a desire to drink blood that the original, the Crimson Moon had. The True Ancestors needed to use a large portion of their power to suppress this impulse, but as there was no cure, and with passage of time the impulse grew, more and more True Ancestors fell and began drinking blood indiscriminately, while others most likely went into eternal sleep. 
 The True Ancestors didn't have a specific reason in creating Arcueid. They normally only mold new True Ancestors to fit specific needs. There was no need for a being as strong as her, but in the end, she originated from nothingness, simply as a product to realize the pointless goal of ""the strongest True Ancestor."" They used her great strength to make her into a weapon, the executioner of the fallen True Ancestors and of the most powerful Dead Apostles. According to Ciel, this happened in the 12th century AD, when the number of fallen True Ancestors was very high. She was able to perform this duty splendidly, but she was nothing more than a tool. She was taught nothing beyond what she needed to know to hunt her targets, to the extent that she even ignored the fact that she was the same kind of creature as those she was supposed to destroy, and went to sleep after every kill, with her accumulated memories erased. 
  
 As the executioner, she did not have any vampiric impulses, and the rest of the True Ancestors also believed she had none. A priest from the church seeking perfect immortality, Michael Roa Valdamjong, needed to become a Dead Apostle to continue his research as he had already reached the potential of his human body. Arcueid, ignorant of her nature as a vampire and the consequences of drinking blood, was easily tricked by Roa into drinking his and turned berserk, wiping out most of the True Ancestors, turning Roa into one of the strongest Dead Apostles and having a considerable portion of her power stolen by him, before she managed to regain her sanity long enough to chain herself to the throne and go to sleep. From then on she had to suppress her urge to drink blood like any other True Ancestors. The rest of the True Ancestors were wiped out either by Roa or the rest of the Dead Apostles, who made a game of trying to assassinate their creators. 
  
 Arcueid finally managed to destroy Roa's original body, although it took an alliance with the Burial Agency to do it. Roa was not killed however, as he had managed to master reincarnation, and constantly reincarnated into host bodies he chose before his deaths. These host bodies were chosen for a mix of social standing (rich families with influence) and the physical/magical potential of the body. After destroying Roa's original body, Arcueid went to sleep and awoke only to kill Roa's re-incarnations constantly, but was never able to destroy him and get her power back as he would simply re-incarnate each time. At the time of Tsukihime, Roa had re-incarnated 17 times, with his last re-incarnation being Tohno SHIKI.

 Kaname is the main female protagonist of the story, and appears to be a ""normal"" 16 year-old high school student at first glance. The character was taken from a friend of the authors, whose name was also Kaname Chidori, living in Japan. However, the discovery of her Whispered abilities attracts the attention of terrorist organizations. As a result, Sousuke has been assigned by Mithril to protect her. While Sousuke Sagara's battle intuition generally saves her from dangerous situations, she often considers Sousuke's instincts an irritant in daily high school events, leading to countless comical situations.",16,,,166 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/59128.jpg

819,"Watanuki, Kimihiro(四月一日 君尋)",xxxHOLiC Movie: Manatsu no Yoru no YumexxxHOLiCxxxHOLiC◆Kei,2370,https://myanimelist.net/character/235/Kimihiro_Watanuki,"Birthday: April 1 
  
 Watanuki is a high school student whose life has been a rather difficult one—not only have both his parents died, forcing him to live alone, but he is plagued daily by spirits that only he can see (both the ability to see them and the cause of their attacks are evidently heritable traits—apparently Watanuki's blood smells very delicious to spirits). 
  
 One day, Watanuki enters into an agreement with Yuuko to work for her in exchange for the fulfillment of his wish–to never see spirits again. This marks the beginning of Watanuki's very involved part-time job, a fated meeting with a certain quartet from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, and so many ""chance"" happenings which occur not out of coincidence, but ""hitsuzen"". 
  
 Watanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. Depending upon the person he talks to, his emotions tend to be overly exaggerated. With Himawari he throws himself into the air accompanied by hearts and a ""Himawari-chaaaaan!!"" squeal. With Domeki, he almost always expresses irritation with various facial expressions, screaming, and arm motions that reminds Himawari of an angry cat. With the exception of these two and Yūko, Watanuki tends to address everyone around him with formality and kindness. 
  
 One of Watanuki's greater problems, especially early on in the manga, is his lack of self-worth. He found absolutely no value in himself and would often use himself to aid another, even if his life were at stake.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/471600.jpg
820,Ein(アイン),Cowboy Bebop: Ein no NatsuyasumiCowboy BebopCowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira,2367,https://myanimelist.net/character/4/Ein,"Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a ""data dog"": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shōgi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 ""Speak Like A Child"" after the credits Ein tells Spike ""Next Episode: Wild Horses"". He is able to ""speak"" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, ""Mushroom Samba"" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of ""Thanks"", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of ""No problem""). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for ""dog"" (犬 inu) but is also German for ""one"". ""Ein"" may also be short for ""Einstein"", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses.

 Battler is the eighteen-year-old son of Rudolf and his first wife Asumu, and is generally considered to be the main protagonist of the series. He is extremely stubborn, and is afraid of ""shaky"" transportation, fearing he might fall off a boat. At first glance, he appears to be hotheaded, cocky, and even a little perverted (given the fact that he tries to grope young ladies and even his cousin Jessica several times). However, he has a heart of gold he isn't afraid to show when the situation calls for it. 
  
 Battler is also an extremely rational young man, and has an extreme talent for deductive reasoning and thinking outside the box, described as ""flipping the chessboard"" so that he may be able to predict the moves and motives of his opponents. Because of this, he does not believe in witches or magic. This causes some conflict with his cousin Maria, who has immersed herself in studies of the occult and believes strongly in witches, especially the Golden Witch Beatrice.",,"July 15, 1968",,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/83717.jpg

He's the big brother figure for Nana O—and sometimes Nobu—and acted as Nana's ""guardian"" when she arrived in Tokyo. While he harbors some feelings for her, he baits Ren to rekindle their love for each other. In the past, he shared several ties with Trapnest's members.

  Height : 184 cm

  Rank : Jonin 
  Likes : Curry and rice, curry udon noodle, Lee, playing catch, repetitive sideways jump 
  
 He is the leader of Team Guy, consisting of Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga, and Tenten. 
  
 Guy, and by extension Lee, lives his life by his own ""My Rules"" philosophy, which involves setting tougher self-imposed penalties for failure so something good comes of it. For example, he vowed to walk 500 laps around Konoha on his hands if he lost a contest with Kakashi, and proceeded to do so upon losing, even though people eventually stopped paying attention. He also doesn't hesitate to do things he doesn't enjoy or that others might find embarrassing if it means his own self-improvement, as seen with his belief that one cannot dislike food regardless of its ingredients or taste. In addition, Guy values his youth to a great degree and dislikes the idea that he may not be as young as he once was. To help remedy this problem he spends large amounts of time with his younger teammates, hoping to acquire some of their youthful properties. Likewise, he often refers to himself as ""Konoha's Prideful Green Beast"". 
  
 Guy is the self-proclaimed rival of Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi, however, is indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Kakashi also seems to have a habit of unintentionally ignoring Guy when Guy is lecturing him, which usually results in Guy asking himselif why Kakashi ""has to act so cool"". Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and has acquired a record of 50 wins and 49 losses in doing so.

 Fate first appears with Arf and Bardiche, materializing in the town in search of Jewel Seeds. It is soon apparent that even Fate does not know why she is looking for these specimens of Lost Logia (the series' term for ancient magical artifacts), but she does not care, stating ""I must get them, because my mother wants them."" Fate is not impressed by her young, naive rival, Nanoha, and tells her that her quest is worthless, but Nanoha's steadfast dedication to reforming Fate gets to her heart, and she begins to wane. However, this does not impress Fate's mother, Precia Testarossa, who tortures the girl just for not getting all the Jewel Seeds. Fate remains loyal despite Arf's protests; she remembers a time when Precia was kind and stable, and thinks that the Jewel Seeds will cure her mother's insanity. 
  
 Fate teleports to her home from the top of an office building with complicated coordinates and a bit of magic. She lives in a gloomy hideout in the Garden of Time with her mother and Arf, sharing a room with the latter. She appears in the city whenever she senses a Jewel Seed, as she has no school and nothing else to do. This is also the reason why she spends much of the series transformed.","9 (Nanoha, A's), 12 (End of The Movie 2nd A's), 15 (End of A's), 19 (StrikerS), 23 (ViVid), 25 (Force)",,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/226585.jpg

One memory of his parents led him to call himself a ""knight,"" an ostentatious term he uses to describe himself, and he wants to fight to protect people. He does not wear a helmet at fire scenes because it does not fit the image of a knight. 
  
 He fights with Excalibur, a sword made of flames that spews out from the hilt of a sword without a blade. For this reason, he has mastered the art of swordsmanship. He also has a disposable ""Mini Excalibur"" made from plastic plates, which he can use for minor welding and cutting. His fighting ability varies depending on his condition and mood. For example, he can kill an opponent instantly when he holds Excalibur with his dominant hand, whereas he can only do very little damage when he swings his sword with the opposite hand. 
  
 Although he has high combat power, he is not very good at intellectual work, and is often treated as an idiot because he makes impossible mistakes and creates misunderstandings, but sometimes he can see things that no one else can. 
 He and Shinra are classmates at the training school, but Shinra is a hero, while Arthur is a knight, so they don't get along well. He has a deep-seated grudge against Shinra for telling him that knights are weak. 
  
 He has a good reputation among the opposite sex because of his good looks, and Shinra says that he is popular even though he is an idiot.

Along with her father, she is the only one who knows the secret concerning Tippy and her grandfather. Chino acts far more maturely than her age, and is normally the most responsible and organized member of the Rabbit House Café. She has a reserved and emotionless disposition, rarely smiling even when happy, and she speaks in a flat monotone voice with polite grammar. She takes her work very seriously and gets annoyed when people act recklessly or loudly around her. Chino resents the way she is often treated like a child due to being the youngest and shortest of the group. She gradually develops a strong bond with Cocoa, sometimes reminiscent of her own sister complex. When not companied by her, she often misses her and shows envy when she’s around others.

863,"Black, Jet(ジェット・ブラック)",Cowboy BebopCowboy Bebop: Tengoku no TobiraCowboy Bebop: Yose Atsume Blues,2214,https://myanimelist.net/character/3/Jet_Black,"Jet, known on his home satellite as the ""Black Dog"" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or ""dad"" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old). 
  
 Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet ""customized"" with larger engines). 
  
 During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/253723.jpg

 Birthday: October 27 
 Blood type: AB 
 Height: 145 cm (4'9"") 
 Affiliation: Vampires 
 Section: Krul Tepes's Faction 
 Rank: Third Progenitor, Queen Vampire Of Japan 
  
 Krul Tepes is the third progenitor among the vampires and the vampire queen of Japan. She is responsible for turning Mikaela Hyakuya into a vampire. Being a Vampire, she is far stronger than a Human and being a Founder among the vampires, she is capable of easily defeating other vampires. 
  
 Just like all other vampires (minus Mikaela), she views the humans as nothing more than livestock. She sees them as foul and endlessly greedy creatures who will do anything for their own personal gain. When Ferid Bathory slaughters the Hyakuya Sect orphans she carefully hid in Sanguinem and protected as livestock, she becomes enraged because he fatally wounded one of the seraph and allowed another to escape. She never mentions a word about the orphans and displays no interest in them. She saves Mika's life against his will by turning him into a vampire, but this appears to have been done for her own personal interests. He refuses to drink human blood, so she gives her blood to him in exchange for making him dependent on her. 
  
 Even so, she is the only vampire who shows him kindness, and there are several moments when she hugs him or treats him gently. After developing a close bond with Mikaela Hyakuya, she shows concern for his family member, Yuichiro Hyakuya. She claims to like both Mika and Yu. However, it is uncertain if this is because she is close with Mika and is concerned for Mika's sake or if this is because she wants to use the seraph for her own purposes. She also appears to trust Mika, and only she and Mika appear to know Krul's true goals.

 Mion is the oldest kid in Keiichi's class. As the elder, she is the class president and everyone looks up to her as the leader. Her social skills are on par with Keiichi, whom she highly respects as a friend and rival (though it is later shown that she has a crush on him). 
  
 She acts like a tomboy, and calls herself oji-san (meaning old man), but has a hidden girlish side. She is next in line to be the head of the Sonozaki household, one of the Three Families which holds tremendous influence in Hinamizawa. She is often seen with a holstered airsoft gun, even though she is never seen using it, and was removed in the PS2 adaption of the game; she is, however, very adept in the use of martial arts. 
  
 Mion also serves as leader of the after-school club consisting entirely of the main characters. She organizes a variety of strategy-based games for the members to play with penalties for any losers. Penalties usually involve wearing embarrassing or frilly outfits on the way home. Each game she organizes involves bending the general rules or using questionable and crude methods to win such as playing cards with a marked deck or using feminine wiles to discourage opposition.",14,July 10,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/442810.jpg

 Age: 23 
 Affiliation: Fairy Tail Guild 
 Occupation: S-Class Mage 
 Team: Thunder God Tribe, Team Fairy Tail, Team Fairy Tail B 
 Magic type: Lightning dragon slayer magic, lightning magic 
  
 Laxus Dreyar is the 23-year-old S-Class mage of Fairy Tail guild. He is the grandson of Fairy Tail's master, Makarov Dreyar, and son of Ivan Dreyar. 
  
 Laxus is a master of Lightning magic. It allows him to produce, control and manipulate lightning and electricity at his will. Through its use, Laxus can not only generate lightning from his body, but also make it appear from almost anywhere to strike his opponents, taking them by surprise. By generating electricity on different parts of his body, he's capable of making his attacks in melee deadlier, and of propelling himself around to gain extra momentum. The bright light from his lightning can be also used to momentarily blind enemies. In addition, much like other Elemental types of Magic, Lightning Magic allows Laxus to turn his own body into lightning, in order to evade enemy attacks, move around at high speed and strike every opponent crossing his path. Lightning dragon's lacrima was implanted into his body when he was young by Ivan Dreyar. Hence, he possesses lightning dragonslayer magic and can also change his skin into dragon scales and use some exclusive dragonslayer attacks like lightning dragon's roar. 
  
 His eye color is different in the manga and the anime. In the manga, it is orange/dark yellow, while the anime portrays it as greenish blue.

He warmed up to Tooru very quickly, even ignoring the fact that he was a Zodiac and hugged her when they were formally introduced. Much to Kyo's horror, Momiji likes to wear the girl's version of their high school uniform, albeit with short shorts and not a skirt. Momiji sometimes sees Tooru at work and helps her clean. He even did Tooru's share once when she was sick with a cold. Momiji also develops feelings for Tooru. He tends to cross dress a lot.

His actual age, origins, and even name are unknown, as he can't recall anything about his life before his encounter with Riko in the First Layer of the Abyss. Riko named him Reg after a dog she used to have. 
  
 Reg's body is extremely durable and resistant to physical damage, and is much lighter than its size would suggest. His arms can be extended to be 40 meters in length, and each of them has a built-in Incinerator relic. These high-powered beam cannons are capable of reducing to ashes almost anything; however, his Incinerator is a weapon of last resort as even a single shot depletes the body's energy almost completely, which in turn makes Reg lose consciousness for 2 hours ten minutes after its use. Having an artificial body, Reg may be the one of the only intelligent beings completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to as an ""Aubade"" or the ""Treasure of the Deep"". 
  
 Despite being a formidable fighter, Reg is rather shy and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. Unlike Riko, Reg becomes easily flustered when in danger, and must often rely on Riko's judgment in difficult situations.

 Mephisto Pheles is the Chairman of True Cross Academy and also an Exorcist. After Fujimoto's death Pheles was ordered to kill Rin, however he accepted Rin's proposal in becoming an Exorcist and entered him into True Cross Academy. It has been heavily implied that he is the son of Satan along with his brother, the Earth King, Amaimon. He possesses the unique and peculiar ability of transforming into a small dog after counting to three in German. How powerful he is has not been shown but he has mentioned that he is an Honorary Knight, the position two ranks below Paladin. He has been shown responsible for allowing several higher class demons onto campus.

 Gender: Female 
 Hair color: Dark pink 
 Eye color: Magenta-purple 
 Band Affiliation: SICK HACK 
  
 Kikuri Hiroi is a supporting character of the manga and anime series, Bocchi the Rock!. She is the bassist and the vocalist of the band, SICK HACK. 
  
 Kikuri is drunk in most of the scenes during the series. For that reason, she is often fined for causing trouble such as breaking the equipment during concerts, and because of that, she drinks more liquor, so although she has some income at the concert, she is always short of money. 
  
 Unlike today, where she behaves freely, Hiroi had a reclusive, gloomy personality until high school. The reason she started drinking was to suppress the tension of concert performances. She sees a lot of qualities that overlap with her former self in Bocchi and occasionally gives advice as a senpai bandsman.

878,Tobi(トビ),Naruto: ShippuudenNaruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 - Hi no Ishi wo Tsugu MonoNaruto x UT,2163,https://myanimelist.net/character/3149/Tobi,"Tobi was formerly Zetsu's subordinate, and became a full Akatsuki member after Sasori's death. He now wears the same ring as Sasori, having recovered it after Sasori's death, and took his place as Deidara's partner. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector, so his place of origin is unknown. He wears an orange mask with single eye-hole covered in a swirl pattern concentrated towards the right eye. This odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak. 
  
 Tobi's area of expertise remains unclear, as he has never been shown fighting. He and Deidara have defeated the three-tailed beast, but Tobi is never shown doing anything but running from it. After the battle, which goes largely unwitnessed, Tobi claims to have knocked it out with a single attack. Deidara disagrees with the assessment, claiming that it was his ""artistic contribution"" (exploding clay) that allowed them to win. During his fight with Sasuke, Tobi shows the ability to recover from what are presumably debilitating or fatal blows. After being slashed across the midsection by Sasuke's sword, Tobi collapses, only to stand up again a few seconds later and complain about the speed of the attack. Aside from this, Tobi has yet to demonstrate any techniques. 
  
 Tobi has a very formal and correct manner of speech. While his physical appearance remains a mystery, Zetsu has implied that he is relatively young when one side of him referred to Tobi as a ""good boy."" He respects Deidara, referring to him as Deidara-senpai. Tobi's personality is rather odd in comparison with other Akatsuki members. While most of the members are dedicated and serious, though somewhat argumentative or even hostile towards each other when not fighting, Tobi is more carefree and goofy, much like Naruto. His personality does not please Deidara, who believes that all Akatsuki members should be serious and calm. Tobi unintentionally irritates Deidara frequently, which usually results in Deidara attacking Tobi in a comedic fashion.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/73577.jpg

His name is derived from the Japanese word for ""honesty"" and his father named him Naota because of that (Fooly Cooly). Unbeknownst to him, he has the ""right kind of head"" to be used as an N.O. channel. He is obsessed with appearing mature and attempts to act nonchalant. This is most expressed in his monologues which open and close each episode where he continues to claims that ""nothing amazing ever happens here"" despite the show's surreal and often absurd happenings. Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku's baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku's old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota's mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature. Much like Amarao, Naota is picky about his drinks (disliking drinks which are sour, bitter, or contain pulp) and hates spicy foods (note thought, he is told to ""cut back on the sour drinks"" by Amarao).",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/117021.jpg

 Inaho's parents died sometime prior to the war and he lived alone with his sister. Waking up, cooking breakfast for his sister, he leaves for his school in Shinawara.

 She loves sharks and snacks, and constantly modifies Nano, whom she created, adding strange and unusual functions such as a roll cake dispensing arm. Nano is usually unaware of these modifications until they are first used. Hakase always refuses to remove the obvious wind-up key from Nano's back on the grounds that it is cute, despite Nano's regular requests. 
 Hakase does not go to school (apparently because she has already graduated) and spends her days playing around in the house instead. Hakase's family is never revealed, though she may be related to the Principal of Tokisadame Highschool since they share a surname. She lives with Nano and Sakamoto.

 She is extremely popular and is famous for ending her sentences with ~datcha (loosely translated as ""yes?"" or ""you know?""). 
  
 Except when in her school girl's uniform, she usually wears a sexy outfit consisting of a tiger-striped bikini and knee-high go-go boots. 
  
 While generally good-natured, sweet, and innocent, Lum also has a very hot temper. Her dream in life is to live in a ""Sweet Home with Darling"" in which she keeps house and raises babies while Ataru works. Unfortunately, Lum's idea of ""cooking"" is to take very spicy ingredients like jalapenos, cayenne peppers, and Tabasco sauce and irradiate them with an alien energy bazooka until they carbonize into inedible, crystallized nuggets. As an alien she has access to many bizarre gadgets whose use she really doesn't understand all that well, leading to comedic results. Differences between human and ""Invader"" physiology also drive many stories, like the time Lum's horns begin to grow larger after she is bitten by a cow, or the time she becomes drunk by eating pickled plums.

 Kazuma is a former member of the Kannagi household. He was banished from the family by his father after he was defeated by Ayano during the Successor Ceremony for the Enraiha, his family's sacred sword. Since Kazuma is a son from the main family, making him the legitimate successor, even his own father considered him a disgrace for lacking the power to use fire magic, his family's specialty. Four years later, at the age of twenty-two, he returns to Japan as a skilled master of the wind arts. Though he was not responsible for the killings in the Kannagi household that began to occur upon his return to Japan, he is still prepared to start a war with his former family. 
  
 The Kannagi family quickly finds out that the meek and powerless Kazuma they once knew is now more powerful than any of them, which frustrates Ayano to no end. 
  
 Before being exiled from the Kanagi family, Kazuma was a kind, caring boy who only wanted his family's love, but after being cast out for being powerless, his personality took a dramatic turn. In the four years after his exile, Kazuma becomes much more cynical about the world around him, especially in matters concerning love, due in no small part to how his family treated him for being powerless. With his wind power, Kazuma tends to look down on members of the Kannagi family, finding it amusing and ironic that the very family who cast him out for being powerless, are now the powerless ones themselves compared to him.",22,,,176 cm (estimation),,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/86237.jpg

 Height: 195 cm (6'4"") 
 Weight: 174 lbs (79 kg) 
 Birthday: July 7 
 Blood type: B 
 Sign: Cancer 
 Likes: Red bean soup, Oha-Asa 
 Dislikes: Cats 
 School: Teiko (Former) Shuutoku High School 
 Position: Shooting Guard 
 Special ability: Shooting from anywhere on the court (Far-Distance Shooter) 
  
 Midorima often acts reserved, mean, and brusque with others, coming off as arrogant—although Takao claims Midorima is just ""tsundere."" He has a hard time acting kind to his opponents and generally hates ""fooling around"" (although Takao often pursues him into it). He can be seen, at all times, with a lucky item due to his strong belief and passion for horoscope. He is left-handed, and always bandages his dominant hand outside of matches (claiming that his hand must be in perfect condition so nothing will influence his shot). He also shapes his nails so that his hands will be in perfect form for shooting. 
  
 Formerly a member of the basketball team of Teikou Middle School, Midorima is a member of the Generation of Miracles (Kiseki no Sedai); during his time with Teikou, his jersey number was seven, switching to six as he joined Shūtoku's. He also served as a vice-captain under Akashi. 
  
 His strength is his absolute accuracy, which is shown in his shots that always go in. He can shoot accurately no matter how far he is from the ring. He is also a really good defender

 Tsunade is the granddaughter of the First Hokage. She is one of the legendary Sannin. 
  
 After his failed invasion of Konoha, Orochimaru approaches Tsunade to get her to heal his arms. While she initially refuses, Orochimaru offers to revive Dan and Nawaki in exchange for healing his arms. Intrigued, Tsunade is left a week to consider the matter. Once meeting Uzumaki Naruto, Tsunade begins to remember the dreams of her two loved ones and how much they loved the village of Konoha. While she longs to see them both again, Tsunade ultimately is unable to bring herself to help Orochimaru, his hopes of destroying Konoha too strong to ignore. Determined to protect the village her loved ones held dear until the end of their lives, Tsunade battles with Orochimaru and eventually defeats him. Having accepted the title of Fifth Hokage, Tsunade returns to Konoha afterwards. 
  
 Since becoming Hokage, Tsunade has primarily acted as a source of assignments, and mobilizes Konoha's forces when need be. In addition, Tsunade plays a large role in healing the more severe injuries that befall upon those she sends on missions. At the end of Part I, Haruno Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice. 
  
 Tsunade's trademark ability is her inhuman strength, which is derived from her excellent chakra control. By storing chakra and releasing it at the point of contact, she can enhance her strength to the point where she can break through boulders with her bare hands. 
  
 She is also an extremely talented Medical-nin, and can heal wounds that most others would consider impossible. As a result of her chakra control and her medical abilities, Tsunade has created a form of regeneration. So she really is near 50 years old, but looks like she were in her twenties.

 Zodiac: Taurus 
 Height: 176 cm (5'9"") 
 Weight: 60 kg 
  
 Shinji Hirako is the former captain of the 5th Division, preceding his lieutenant Sōsuke Aizen. He distrusted Aizen from the day they met, and thus made him lieutenant so he could keep an eye on him. Because Shinji never socialized with Aizen, however, he was easily deceived by Aizen's actions, culminating to his conversion into a hollow. Shinji's character is somewhat comical, adding a bit of levity to situations that are otherwise serious. He seems to like annoying his associate, Hiyori Sarugaki, which usually earns him a slap from one of her sandals. He also appears to have a history of referring to cute girls he meets as his 'first love', complete with a deadpan look on his face despite the obvious lie (he apparently never did this with Hiyori, further annoying her). An early design of Shinji can be seen in the first chapter's cover art, making it clear he was planned well before his introduction. During several points in the anime, Shinji's outfit is depicted to look like Lupin the III, likely as a homage on the part of the animators. 
  
 Shinji's hollow mask resembles a pharaoh's mask. Shinji is quite skilled with his hollow powers, using a single cero blast to easily overwhelm Grimmjow Jeagerjaques. The video games also depict him being able to split the cero blasts into a pyramid shaped attack. 
  
 Shinji's zanpakutō, Sakanade (逆撫) has the power of creating an inverted world. The power is an optical illusion which is caused by the scent the sword gives off upon its release. It inverts an opponent's sense of direction causing the directions of up and down, left and right as well as forward and backward becoming the opposite. It is not just the sense of direction that is changed; the opponent's eyesight and where they get cut is reversed as well. 
  
 In its sealed form, Sakanade resembles a normal katana with red hilt and sheath whereas upon its release, its hilt becomes a large ring which Shinji places his hand in the middle of allowing him to freely control its movement without physically holding onto it if he so chooses. The ring is attached to a normal sword hilt with a normal rectangular hand guard. The first few inches of the blade are covered by as extension of the hand guard. Sakanade's blade is straight and slim with the tip ending in a slanted razor-like edge instead of being tapered to a point. There are five holes along the swords length.

Because Saiki is unable to detect Nendo's presence, Nendo is the only person who is able to sneak up on Saiki and making him think he will someday be a dangerous foe. 
  
 Nendo believes he is a friend of Saiki, but this is definitely not the case as Saiki despises Nendo. Saiki would often compare Nendo to a bug, as bugs are one of the few animals that Saiki cannot read the minds of.

 Kotetsu T.

He starts the series as one of the least popular heroes of Sternbild City, but he seems to care more about helping the people in the city than earning ratings, points, or fame. 
  
 At the age of 10, he was present during an attempted bank robbery which was foiled by the veteran hero Mr. Legend. 
  
 One of the criminals took Kotetsu hostage and the latter activated his NEXT powers out of stress and fear, sending his captor flying across the room. Kotetsu believed that anyone who touched him while his power was active would be hurt, but Mr. Legend convinced him otherwise and told him that his power was meant to save people.

 Birthday: December 9th

 Hates: His P.E. Teacher 
 Weapon: Delflinger (デルフリンガー), a sentient sword 
  
 Saito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French. 
  
 There are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gandálfr (ガンダールヴ, Gandāruvu?). These runes glow when his Gandálfr powers activate. As a Gandálfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gandálfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings. 
  
 The series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her. 
  
 Saito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset. 
  
 Although he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his ""snobbish"" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name ""My Louise"" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise. 
  
 His partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gandálfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming ""All that he is good at is protecting her."" He is revealed to be a Gandálfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname ""Our Sword"" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gandálfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as ""ability man.""",17,,,"172 cm (5'8"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/50370.jpg

915,Satoshi(サトシ),PokemonPokemon Movie 01: Mewtwo no GyakushuuPokemon Movie 02: Maboroshi no Pokemon Lugia Bakutan,2039,https://myanimelist.net/character/2473/Satoshi,"Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the japanese animation, Pokémon. There are also incarnations of him in the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, the Pocket Monsters Zensho manga, and the Ash & Pikachu manga. He is loosely based on the male protagonist of the Pokémon Red and Blue. The family name ""Ketchum"" is a pun of the anime's former tagline and slogan ""Gotta catch 'em all!"" 
  
 At the beginning of the series, Ash was 10 years old. In the short called ""Pikachu & Pichu"" which was attached to Pokémon 3: The Movie, he said the day when the events depicted in the short took place was the day he met Pikachu, meaning his age at that time would be at least 11. However, two seasons later, the official Japanese Pokémon website reported that Ash was the same age as May, who was 10 years old at the time. This and the fact that the two are at the same height suggests that none of the characters have aged since the show began, placing the Pokemon anime in a floating timeline. 
  
 Ash is a caring and valiant trainer but he can be confident to the point of arrogance and is known for being stubborn at times. He also has quite the reckless streak, which has led him to troublesome situations and even near death. But when in a Pokémon battle, he is highly competitive, and he shows tremendous presence of mind, taking advantage of the battlefield as well the nature of his and the enemy Pokémon's moves to claim victory after victory, though he has been known to lose from time to time. 
  
 Ash has matured greatly over the course of the series, and has considerably improved his abilities as a trainer, but his earnestness and determination remain the same. During the first season of the series, Ash trained to catch more Pokémon than his childhood rival, Gary Oak, although Gary has caught more. He soon begins to focus more on each of his Pokémon's abilities. He also impresses many trainers by winning battles in which his Pokémon has a type disadvantage. At the Johto League Silver Conference Ash finally won a battle against Gary. 
  
 Throughout the anime, Ash has met a number of rivals, including Richie, whom he faced in the Indigo League, and Casey, a diehard Electabuzz fanatic. During Pokémon tournaments, Ash has made rivals out of Harrison, Jackson, Morrison, and Tyson (the last of which went on to become the champion of the Hoenn Pokémon league). Near the beginning of Pokémon: Diamond & Pearl, Ash meets an arrogant young trainer named Paul, who quickly becomes his new rival. 
  
 Ash's primary nemesis is a group of comical antagonists named Team Rocket. Ever since the second episode, ""Pokémon Emergency!"" two Team Rocket operatives named Jessie and James, along with a talking Meowth, have always tried to steal his first Pokémon Pikachu but have always failed. There are some occasions when they work together like the Pokémon: The Movie 2000. 
  
 Ash's mother is Delia Ketchum (Hanako in Japan). She is a caring and thoughtful woman, though occasionally oblivious as her son, and in the English version of the anime often pesters him to change his boxer shorts every day, a gag throughout the early episodes of the first few series. 
  
 The identity of his father has remained unknown. One reference to him exists in the anime. During a phone conversation between Ash and his mother in the second episode, she states to her amazement that he got from Pallet Town to Viridian City in one day. ""It took your father four days to get there when he started Pokémon training,"" she says, ""He'll be so proud!"" A line from the play, Pokémon Live!, suggests that Delia, at one time, had a relationship with the leader of Team Rocket, Giovanni when she was a teenager, but in the anime, no evidence of Giovanni being Ash's father has been shown currently. 
  
 In the episode ""Showdown at Dark City,"" Ash went by the name of Tom Ato (tomato) after spotting some ketchup that Pikachu was eating. He had to disguise his name, so that his real name would not get a bad reputation, since he was dealing with the rivaling Yas and Kas gyms. 
  
 Ash was based off Red, a playable character from the generation l games, Pokémon Red, Blue and Green, he was also based off Satoshi Tajiri's childhood self.

919,Suigintou(水銀燈),Rozen MaidenRozen Maiden: TräumendRozen Maiden: Ouvertüre,2019,https://myanimelist.net/character/1072/Suigintou,"Suigintou is the first doll of the Rozen Maiden collection. Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of ""Father"" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than ""Father"". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice. 
  
 Suigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Träumend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Träumend finale, she tells Shinku that ""Father"" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/220173.jpg

 Height: 181cm 
 Favorite food: Potato salad with ham and corn. (No apple or mandarin! nothing too sweet or sour; hates tomatoes) 
  
 Kurosaki works as the school janitor. He is also a computer hacker. 
  
 He is a drinker, smokes a lot, is violent, dangerous, scary, and calls Teru his servant. He is quite good-looking as well. He does not display his emotions normally but when he gets angry, he can be very terrifying. He swears at times, and likes to eat. He is an excellent cook, but usually commands Teru to cook. However, he can be protective of Teru when she is in danger. And yes, he is in love with her.",24,,,181cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/239495.jpg
922,"Touden, Laios(ライオス・トーデン)",Dungeon Meshi PVsDungeon MeshiDungeon Meshi 2nd Season,2006,https://myanimelist.net/character/134262/Laios_Touden,"Age: 26 
 Birthday: November 26, 488 
 Birthplace: Northern Continent 
 Height: 185cm 6'1"" 
 BMI: 26 
  
 Despite being looked down on by most characters, Laios is an incredibly strong fighter and the leader of the party. He uses the knowledge gained from cooking monsters to develop techniques to defeat them, but is also shown to have certain mythology and biological factors of them memorized, as shown with the dragons in the fight with the Lunatic Magician. He is a very calm and gentle person but gets very passionate when he talks about monsters, which irritates most of the people around him. He tends to speak very quickly when excited and makes animated hand gestures as well as facial expressions, a complete 180 from his usual demeanor. 
  
 Though he's intelligent and passionate when it comes to monsters, as well as talented with combat, he falters in most situations outside of the dungeon. He's shown to struggle with other people, missing social cues and being overly blunt, which often leads to arguments with others. 
  
 Despite having good intentions and seeing most people as his friends, those same people are uncomfortable around Laios and see him as someone who has the potential to become ""evil"" due to not understanding him. Though this struggle persists throughout the series, he stays extremely friendly and accepting towards others, even if they do not do the same for him, being quick to forge friendships with other groups and even orcs. Possibly due to his indifference towards most living things other than monsters, he doesn't really see a difference between himself and other races, including the orcs. 
  
 Despite his deep love and admiration of monsters he has no illusions to the threat they pose. If anything his reverence of them has made him extra cautious to them. 
  
 His favorite foods are dairy products, especially cheesecake, and his least favorite type of foods are squid/octopus.

 Favourite quote: ""I... I'm not Yoshinon. I'm Yoshino. Yoshinon is my best friend."" 
  
 Yoshino is a spirit and an important character in Date A Live series. She is the second Spirit saved by Shido. Yoshino is a shy girl who is said to be the Kindest spirit up to date. Her codename is Hermit. 
  
 When Yoshino first appeared in the series, it was also when she first encountered Shidou. To Shidou, Yoshino appeared to be a lost child wandering around in the rain. The next time they met, Yoshino fell under attack from the AST and ran away. The third time they met was when Shidou made the decision to save Yoshino from herself and from the AST for he discovered that Yoshino was an extremely kind child even towards the people who were hunting and attacking her. 
  
 After having most of her power sealed by Shidou, Yoshino started living in one of Ratatoskr's living quarters on Fraxinus temporarily before she moved down to the apartment complex next to Shidou's home. Yoshino is currently practicing with the help from Ratatoskr how to speak for herself, or to be more precise, how to speak without the aid of Yoshinon. 
  
 Yoshino has the appearance of a young girl, at about 13 to 14 years of age, with blue eyes and hair, wearing a light-blue short dress and outside, wearing a large green raincoat with a pair of rabbit-ear hood, holding a rabbit puppet, Yoshinon, in her left hand. The raincoat seems to have a tail with a pink ribbon attaching to it. Her preferred form of clothing appears to be sundresses along with boots that match her raincoat. 
  
 After her spirit power was sealed, the dress under her raincoat is the one she is wearing now, adding a hat with a ribbon attach to it and still holding Yoshinon, her puppet. Yoshinon is a mischievous white rabbit puppet that Yoshino always holds in her left hand. Yoshinon's right eye has a black button with a brown band that resembles a eyepatch, while its left eye is a very small pink dot. 
  
 At her first appearance, Yoshino is a very shy girl, unable to articulate full sentences and express herself well. Other than Yoshino, she has her other personality named Yoshinon which is the rabbit in her left arm. Yoshino says it's her hero for protecting her from bad guys (which are the ASTs). It is also said that Yoshino created Yoshinon in order to restrain herself from hurting humans. As she lets Yoshinon do the talking for her with its outgoing personality. She improves after Shidou seals her powers and begins learning to integrate herself into society. Later in the story, most of the time Yoshino will force herself to speak personally while conversing with Shidou, instead of using her puppet Yoshinon. 
  
 Yoshino has the ability to manipulate all states of water (solid, liquid, and gas) in her surrounding area. She usually uses her powers for defensive purposes only due to her kind and shy nature. 
  
 Her Angel, Zadkiel, is a huge puppet that resembles Yoshinon. Zadkiel has two forms, the first form resembles Yoshinon but is a lot bigger, with one red round eye and an eyepatch, large sharp teeth, and white skin. In this form, Zadkiel has the ability to absorb water from the ground and air and release it in the form of an attack. Yoshinon is also able to talk through the puppet, and acts as a limiter to suppress the Angel's powers so that it doesn't end up killing anyone. Zadkiel's second form appears to be its true form, this form also resembles Yoshinon but is even larger than when Yoshinon becomes Zadkiel. The second form is larger than a many-story building, and does not have an eyepatch. This Zadkiel has the same powers as the other but is a lot more powerful. Even Yoshino has problems controlling the Angel. 
  
 When using Sirion, Yoshino fuses with Zadkiel, gaining an ice armour over her Astral Dress. Her powers over water and ice increased to the point of the surrounding area being frozen. Shido remarked that she looked like she was wearing Zadkiel. 
  
 Being a passive Spirit, Yoshino prefers to take non-aggressive actions such as running and hiding as opposed to engaging in combat against her enemies. Yoshino's Astral Dress is named El, and has enough defensive power to block an AST missile barrage.

 Car: Subaru Impreza WRX STI Coupe Type R Version V (GC8) (color: Sonic Blue Mica in anime/Gunmetal Gray Mica in manga) 
 Likes: the sound of a carburetor, tobacco 
 Dislikes: tofu, large cars 
  
 Bunta Fujiwara is the owner of a tofu shop in Akina, and the father of Takumi. He used to be the No.1 downhill racer in Mt. Akina years ago, but he no longer races, preferring to guide Takumi's racing development. He is the original driver of the mysterious AE86 that holds the record of the fastest downhill time at Akina. Bunta has a unique way of training his son to drive; every morning when Takumi delivers tofu, Bunta gives Takumi a cup of water. The cup of water is placed in the drink holder; Takumi must not spill even a drop of it while he is driving. This is ostensibly to prevent breaking the tofu in the boot, but it forces Takumi to drive very smoothly. As for Bunta, he is still considered the fastest downhill racer in Akina. We see proof of this early in the series as he pushes the Trueno with Yuuichi in the passenger seat lighting a cigarette while drifting around a corner.

 Height: 157 cm (5'2"") 
 Three sizes: B83-W54-H84 
 Blood type: B 
 Occupation: freelance assassin 
 Faction: Night Raid 
 Hobby: eating lollipops 
 Teigu: Gaea Foundation 
 Famous quote: ""A girl's weapon is her makeup."" 
  
 Chelsea is one of the newest members of the assassin's group, Night Raid. She is an assassin working for the Revolutionary Army, having successfully carried out countless missions. While she is somewhat aloof and carefree when not on the job, she is also extremely objective and is often quite blunt when voicing her opinions. Her town was eradicated by the Empire upon suspicion of harboring rebels. 
  
 She has a mischievous personality, but this may be only an act. She has also has a cold and calculating side which can often lead to her making a blunt (but accurate) analysis of a person or situation. Chelsea is shown to have good intentions and tried to help the Night Raid members to become more realistic, as she was shown to deeply care for them and didn't want to lose them like she lost her old team. She is shown to have a love for lollipops as her Teigu was filled with them and Chelsea is usually shown having one in her mouth. 
  
 Chelsea seems to insult both Sheele and Bulat at first in episode 12, which ticks off Mine and Tatsumi. However, she later shares with him that the last group she was with died except for her, and was hoping their unit cohesion was strong so they could assist each other and survive. 
  
 Her Teigu, ""Gaea Foundation,"" is a cosmetics box that allows her to instantly change her appearance and build at will. 
  
 Chelsea is a veteran assassin who is on equal footing with Akame in terms of experience and number of kills. In addition, she was built up as one of the most genre-savvy characters in the series.

 Akari is a polite red-haired girl who is supposedly the main protagonist of the series. However, due to her rather small presence and plain personality, she is often forgotten about or pushed into the background. One of her few features is hair dumplings which sometimes come off strangely. She is often thought of as having the ability to fire her hair dumplings and turn invisible whilst shouting ""Akkari~n!"". Kyōko and Yui are her childhood friends, while Chinatsu, Sakurako and Himawari are her classmates.

 He is partly instrumental in Saya's ""awakening"" and his right arm is covered in bandages, hiding some Chiropteran features that he is unable to change back into human form.

Haji first met Saya when he was a child of age 12 and was brought by Joel to be her companion and hopefully mate and create more specimens someday. At this time Saya was 43 although she doesn't appear to be since she stopped aging in 1863. He lived with her in Joel's mansion for many years. But one day he fell from a cliff in an attempt to pick a flower that Saya wanted as a present for Joel's birthday. Seeing him bleeding everywhere and not really understanding that people don't drink blood to remain healthy, Saya gave him her own blood. Thus she unwittingly turned him into her ""Chevalier.""

While she wishes she could spend her time with Shio forever in their apartment, she is aware of the fact that they cannot live on peacefully if she does not work and earn money for food, utilities, etc. Because of this, Satou often has to confront the outside world where people interfere with her relationship due to her past history of accepting anyone who has confessed to her and changing partners every three days. Satou is prone to severe animosity when people disrupt her relationship with their interpretation of ""love,"" and can be easily provoked when it comes to Shio due to her overprotectiveness.

His superior is James Black and his partner is Jodie Starling. He had infiltrated the Black Organization under the name Moroboshi Dai—and the codename ""Rye""—as a mole and dated Miyano Akemi, one of their low-ranking members, to feed information to the FBI. In order to facilitate the latter, and later because he had genuinely developed feelings for Akemi, Akai saw himself forced to break up his then on-going relationship with Jodie. Later on, his cover in the Black Organization was accidentally blown by his colleague Andre Camel, and when Akemi was killed, he declared her murderer, Gin (with whom he seems to have had some tensions even before his exposure), his personal enemy. 
  
 Akai is a very professional agent. Even in personal matters, he remains cool, even detached, from anyone, but his redeeming value is a great sense of loyalty to anyone he knows. He is a skilled and relentless pursuer and detective, qualities which have labeled him the number one enemy of the Black Organization and earned him the nickname ""Silver Bullet."" He looks forward to opportunities to hunt the Black Organization down and get revenge for Akemi. He also acts somewhat independently among the FBI and even his boss James Black has trouble getting ahold of him.

 Miko Yotsuya is the main character of the series Mieruko-chan. She has the ability to see spirits, even very powerful ones that are invisible to other mediums, with total clarity. This ability is active constantly, so she always sees spirits in her day-to-day life, and due to their terrifying appearance and threatening behavior, she constantly fears for her life. She has noticed that if she doesn't acknowledge them, spirits will not bother her, so she must remain stoic and unflinching in the face of supernatural terrors, though her act crumbles as soon as she feels safe.

 Mukuro Rokudo is one of the main characters of Reborn! and is also the first season's primary villain. 
  
 Portrayed as the series' first primary antagonist, Mukuro Rokudo is introduced as a 15-year-old Mafia criminal who is the leader of the Kokuyo Gang, which consists of heinous criminals whom have recently escaped from prison. However, later on in the series, he takes on a more supportive role for the series' main characters, becoming somewhat of an ally rather than an enemy, though he prefers to not consider himself as one of their allies. 
  
 Despite often being shown with a playful smile, Mukuro is seemingly apathetic to the suffering of others. Appearing as the series' first antagonist, Mukuro is not averse to disposing of those who get in his way, and is not easily intimidated, usually speaking to others in a very direct and arrogant manner. He cares little for others, and simply considers people to be ""toys"" or ""tools"" he can sacrifice in order to get to what he wants. 
  
 Mukuro is implied to have a strong dislike for the entire Mafia underground, due in part to the experimentations he suffered as a child at the hands of the Estraneo Mafia family. When Mukuro killed his captors, he offered Chikusa and Ken, who were also victims of experimentation, a chance to join him in his quest to destroy the world. However, not only does he want to take revenge on the Mafia by destroying it, he also wants to cleanse the world of its filth by invoking universal suffering through a world war.",15,,,177.5 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/47183.jpg
984,Bentham(ベンサム),One Piece: Mezase! Kaizoku Yakyuu OuOne PieceOne Piece Movie 08: Episode of Alabasta - Sabaku no Oujo to Kaizoku-tachi,1825,https://myanimelist.net/character/4875/Bentham,"Mr. 2 Bon Clay is an ""okama"", a Japanese slang term for someone who is queer. He has a flamboyant attitude, and is prone to singing and dancing. His martial art style is called ""Okama Kenpo"" in the Japanese manga. Bon Clay ate the Devil Fruit, Mane Mane no Mi (Clone Clone Fruit) which allows him to transform into an exact copy of anyone he has touched. Mr. 2 Bon Clay's swans form the shape of a two. He is defeated by Sanji but is considered a friend by the Straw Hat Pirates, even aiding them in their escape from Alabasta. 
  
 Mr. 2 Bon Clay is the only Officer Agent in Baroque Works without a female partner. This stems from the belief that, as an okama, he fills both roles by himself. Likewise, his name is a composite of a male Baroque Works agent's number and a female agent's holiday-based name. ""Bon Clay"" is celebrated in Japan on either July 15 or August 15 because of the use of a lunar calendar. It is a Buddhist celebration found on the last day of the Bon festival, honoring the dead. Lanterns are lit, and the Bon-Odori is traditionally danced.)",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/146037.jpg
985,"Mikk, Tyki(ティキ・ミック)",D.Gray-manD.Gray-man Hallow,1823,https://myanimelist.net/character/778/Tyki_Mikk,"Shortly after Allen meets Arystar and recruits him into becoming an ally, he met Tyki. The man lives a double life: his ""white side"" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic ""dark side"" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists). 
  
 Tyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs. 
  
 The author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross. 
  
 Tyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air. 
  
 His powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds. 
 He also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight). 
  
 He usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades. 
 He was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry.

 Birthday: May 3 
 Height: 162 cm 
 Weight: 51 kg 
 BWH: 88-59-87 cm 
  
 Yui is a girl in Rito's class who seems more strict than the others and seems initially uptight about school morals. This attitude can be traced back to her childhood, given that the boys in her class would sexually harass her classmates by flipping their skirts, and picking on her friends. Yui took it upon herself to stand up for her classmates and came to detest boys and shamelessness as a result. 
  
 She quickly comes at odds with Lala and her free-spirited personality, which she sees as a hindrance towards making the school a more peaceful and better place. Likewise, she has a certain distaste for Rito, given that his frequent mishaps lead to misunderstandings concerning his true nature. At first, she believes him to be just another shameless pervert, but gradually she begins understanding this is not the case. 
  
 Eventually, she loosens up a bit, but she's generally more on her guard than the other girls. She becomes a part of Rito's harem all the same. 
  
 In the anime version it is also implied (albeit rather briefly) that she might have feelings for Rito. In the original manga version, however, this is made evident, to the point she even fantasizes about marrying Rito and adopting Celine as her own child. This also causes her attitude to shift, especially in the latter half of the manga, where she mellows out a lot, especially around Rito. 
  
 It should be noted that there is a huge rift in terms of how her personality is portrayed between the anime and the manga, especially in the first season where Yui is depicted as far stricter and harsher than she really is. Her introduction episode in the anime makes a very radical departure to her portrayal in the manga, depicting her as extremely puritanical and authoritarian. This is eventually toned down but this initial portrayal has also caused such a reputation to stick among anime-only viewers. 
  
 Likewise, a good deal of her scenes from the manga concerning her character development have either remained unadapted or given to Haruna instead. For example, in the OVAs it's Rito and Haruna who travel together to the fantasy RPG crafted by Lala's sisters, however, in the source material this role was originally given to Yui. It is uncertain why the directors chose to diminish her role in the series, given her popularity among the fanbase. 
  
 In the post-manga interview the authors Saki Hasemi and Kentaro Yabuki declared she was introduced as the only character meant to develop, in contrast to the rest of the cast which were written to sort of ""reset"" with each chapter, given the slice-of-life setting. This changed in To Love Ru Darkness, which was more story-driven, were most characters are given some sort of development.",16,,,162 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/150171.jpg

 Zodiac: Leo 
 Height: 166 cm 
 Weight: 55 kg 
 Age: 16, 18 (Silver Soul Aftermath), 21-22 (Be Forever Yorozuya) 
  
 Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the ""Otsu's Imperial Guard,"" a pop-singer's fan club. 
  
 Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel. 
  
 Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordmanship his dojo teaches. 
  
 In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place. 
  
 His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.

Elves in Berserk can only be seen by the open-minded; the devoutly religious cannot see Puck at all, though he can play with their face unbeknownst to them. Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his ""Bloody Needle"" attack, tossing a spiny object resembling a seed pod at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count. 
  
 Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.

993,Pikachu(ピカチュウ),PokemonPokemon Movie 01: Mewtwo no GyakushuuPokemon Movie 02: Maboroshi no Pokemon Lugia Bakutan,1813,https://myanimelist.net/character/3891/Pikachu,"Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs. Therefore Pikachu is a faculative biped. 
  
 In the anime, it has been shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. The anime has also shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In the manga, it has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant . While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter. 
  
 Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the anime, Pikachu has been known to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu . 
  
  Forms 
 Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. 
  
  Cosplay Pikachu 
 Cosplay Pikachu is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. 
  
  Pikachu in a cap 
 Pikachu in a cap is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from the anime. Pikachu in a cap is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Pikachu in a Cap cannot use Catastropika or Gigantamax. 
  
  Partner Pikachu 
 The partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not along with having higher base stats compared to a normal Pikachu. The partner Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, and Splishy Splash, as well as the partner power Pika Papow. 
  
  Gigantamax Pikachu 
 As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time. 
  
  Evolution 
 Pikachu evolves from Pichu and evolves into Raichu . 
 In Alola, it evolves into Alolan Raichu. 
 Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, Partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.

 Tomoyo, Madison Taylor in the English dub, is the best friend of the series heroine, Sakura Kinomoto. When she discovers that Sakura has become the Cardcaptor, she becomes Sakura's primary assistant by designing ""battle costumes"" and filming all of her magical (and non-magical) endeavours. (The videotaping, however, seems to be more to Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than it is to Sakura's.) Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need. 
  
 Tomoyo is very mature for her age. One of her major character traits is her selflessness towards Sakura. Tomoyo is kind, caring, highly intelligent, beautiful, meticulous, and very melodic (she has a superb singing voice and often has solos in choir recitals). She always speaks using formal verb conjugations and expressions, giving her a unique air of refinement amongst the cast. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in the final movie.

As such, she's also the only Saint who isn't under the supervision of Mora. Her power allows her to freely create explosives during battles, and greatly increases the damage caused by her gun's bullets. In Rokka no Yuusha's world, guns aren't powerful enough to injure a kyouma, but in Fremy's case, she can easily kill most of the kyouma as well as most armored humans in one single shot.

 Birthday: June 1 
 Zodiac: Gemini 
 Height: 170 cm 
 Weight: 55 kg 
  
 Kamui is a member of the Yato Tribe, the son of Umibouzu and older brother of Kagura. His excellent fighting skills helped him become Captain of the 7th Division of Harusame's Thunder Guns, the most powerful combat unit within the Harusame group and Overlord of Yoshiwara. Since defecting from the Harusame, he no longer holds these positions. 
  
 Kamui firmly believes that the Yato are to remain on the battlefield and shows his disapproval of Housen staying locked up in Yoshiwara. Because of this belief, he shows no pity towards family or subordinates as a sign of weakness is unacceptable. He tried to revive the abandoned tradition of Yato clan's men killing their own parent to prove their strength, although failed to successfully execute it and only cut his father's arm off. 
  
 Despite this, he pays respect to the opponents he kills by sending them off with a smile. He doesn't kill children, and dislikes killing women because they may give birth to strong children.

 Maple/ Kaede Honjou is the main character, who has just started playing NewWorld Online. Since she doesn't like to get hurt, she puts every skill point she earns into boosting her defense, allowing her to acquire new skills and level up simply by withstanding attacks. Even with her lack of gaming experience, Maple remarkably gains enough resistance to almost anything, giving the game admins many headaches on how to slow her down; to which, her unorthodox methods overcomes the developers' adjustments. She seems to have an innate luck ability to locate rare items, hidden dungeons, and unique quests and skills (such as the Loving Sacrifice quest where she gains a second form).

1027,Batou(バトー),Koukaku KidoutaiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone ComplexInnocence,1746,https://myanimelist.net/character/2653/Batou,"Batou (also Batto, Bato) is nominally the second-in-command of Section 9.  Little is known about the strange, large foreigner who has been with Motoko Kusanagi for years.  He was once American and served in the Special Forces in South America.  His amount of cyborg-ization is variable according to the storyline, from his limbs only up to most of his body, second only to the Major herself.  Despite the availability of superior eyes, he grew superstitious about his old-style eye replacements, popular with many high-level military operatives.  He also retains some residual body-image issues, causing him to continually purchase workout equipment despite the obvious anachronism. 
  
 In the two Stand Alone Complex series, Batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. He is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. Being emotional and not as calm as the Major, Batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. He sometimes shows impatience with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly. 
  
 At times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the Major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. Both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each Gig. This tension is touched upon, briefly, in the Solid State Society movie, where Batou admits that he's been covering up any of the Major's appearances in cases prior to the Puppet Master case. 
  
 Batou had served in a military special forces team before entering Section 9. Most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. Despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, Batou lifts weights as a hobby. Based on several of the Stand Alone Complex episodes, Batou seems to have served in the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force at some point before he joined Section 9. It is suggested several times that he held a JGSDF Ranger qualification. His unit was involved in World War IV and was deployed to South America alongside Motoko Kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an American Imperial Navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed ""Project Sunset,"" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. Batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. They are standard cybernetic equipment issued to Ranger Special Forces operatives.

 Born in the noble realm, He doesn't care for class or your family name, only that you contribute to a better world. With this information, some fans believed that Julius may have been a peasant himself. 
  
 After successfully passing the Magic Knights exam, Julius joined the Grey Deer squad. Currently known as the Aqua Deer to fans of the show, Julius's squad possessed a number of notable characters. At some point, the Wizard King was chosen to lead the squad. 
  
 As Captain, Julius recruited Yami Sukehiro, current captain of the Black Bulls. Despite Yami being a foreigner who was ostracized by the kingdom, Julus recognized his potential. The two grew close and their friendship is a highlight of the show. Surprising to some viewers, Julius Novachrono didn't always want to become Wizard King. As a Royal Knight, he was happy in his role as it allowed him to satisfy his obsession with magic and meet powerful mages in the process. 
  
 As expected from the giant nerd, Julius possesses an incredible amount of magical knowledge, far surpassing that of the Magic Knights Captains. After Yuno gains a new power during the investigation of a dungeon, Julius immediately recognizes this as the wind spirit Sylph, despite the fact that Yuno knew very little about the power himself or how to even control it. 
  
 Additionally, the Wizard King managed to decipher an ancient magical item designed by the very first Wizard King over 500 years ago. But even Julius has his limits, such as when he was surprised by Asta's anti-magic sword. 
  
 Don't let his happy-go-lucky attitude deceive you, Julius can be ruthless when required. Throughout the anime, the Wizard King demonstrates kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Even when fighting Patolli, Julius preferred to capture him alive in order to save William's body. 
  
 However, this doesn't mean that he is soft. When the Eye of The Midnight Sun attacked the kingdom and captured Asta, in the blink of an eye Julius killed two members of the terrorist organization. The man is willing to take a life in order to save those he cares about.

After making their way to sector G, Crow destroyed the Necro Macro security robot which had been chasing Ganta, Shiro and Yoh. After a small skirmish, and an interruption by Shiro, Crow was subdued by the Deadman security. The next day, Ganta and Senji were slated to be the next two Deadmen to compete in the ""Carnival Corpse."" Despite Senji's experience and skill with his 'branch' ability, Ganta managed to win by fooling Senji. As a consequence for losing, Senji's right eye was removed for research. He returns a short time later during Ganta's next match, sporting an eyepatch and gives Ganta assistance with figuring out his opponent's techniques. He also helps Ganta understand his own capabilities. His change in personality toward Ganta is due to his respect for Ganta's strength. Senji comments that because Ganta beat him, he is not allowed to lose until they have a rematch. 
  
 He seems to thoroughly enjoy violence, and his favorite phrase is ""Dead Center."" Despite his wild and battle-hungry attitude, he does have a sense of honor and respects strength and determination. In an ironic twist, Senji becomes flustered and embarrassed when a woman acts immodest. When he first notices Shiro's form fitting body tights, his face becomes red and he give her his coat telling her to quickly cover up. 
  
 His Branch of Sin is called ""Crow Claw."" It manifests as two large scythe-like blades, made of blood, extending from long cuts on his forearms. He makes these cuts using two bladed rings he wears on his thumbs. While the blades are typically two to three feet long, Senji has demonstrated the ability to greatly lengthen them allowing him to attack people at range. He is responsible for naming Ganta's 'Branch of Sin' (Ganta Gun).  He also has a supersonic attack called Invisible Black. 
  
 Senji used to be a policeman before his time in DW. It's hinted that he killed four friends.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/120298.jpg

 Rea is friendly with everyone at the shrine, including Darin despite her intentions to use Rea as a research subject. She calls Mero by Mero-Chan similar to that of Mero's mother which causes Mero great discomfort at first. Similarly, she calls Darin with the -Chan suffix to Darin's discontent.

He has been fighting on the battlefields, using only his bare hands, since the age of sixteen, when he fought against both American and Vietcong in the Vietnam War. Since then, it appears that he has obtained respect from the American forces, and has begun fighting as a kind of mercenary for them.

 Eye color: Light Gray 
 Blood type: O 
 Known relatives: Kasugano Haruka (twin brother) 
  
 She is a quiet, fragile and reclusive girl, and fraternal twin sister to the main protagonist. Cursed with illness and frailty since birth, Sora was denied the sort of independent life that many take for granted. Yet beneath Sora's angelic doll-like appearance lies a troublesome personality that’s prone to withdrawn laziness and demonstrates a rather severe lack of social graces. In all honesty, Sora doesn't care for anyone else, and would much rather just surf the Internet and eat instant food, for as long as Haruka is always by her side. It's implied that her strong bond with Haruka, strengthened as a result of the tragic loss of their parents, may be leading her towards fantasies of incest between twins. She hates Nao, although it is implied that they were once good friends. She is often seen carrying a rabbit doll, which she received as a present before she and Haruka left the village.

Like Ash, Shorter is an unusual ""thug"" with a deep sense of honor, and a drive to always do the right thing. He'll go to any lengths to protect his loved ones... even when the interests of those closest to him come into irreconcilable conflict. 
  
 Shorter is clever, resourceful, and as tough as steel. He's equally skilled at brawling, shooting, and sneaking around like a shadowy thief. Shorter can disguise himself as a completely different person, and fool even Eiji into thinking that he is a dotty old Chinese man. 
  
 Shorter has an irrepressible sense of humor and can wear a lopsided, devilish grin even during the grimmest of circumstances. Like Ash, he is a charismatic leader who can easily unite the other kids on the street under his rule. 
  
 At the beginning of the series, Shorter has a mohawk hairdo. But by volume two he has shaved off all of his hair and is completely bald. Shorter's trademark fashion statement is his ever-present sunglasses. He even wears them while sneaking around a cornfield in the middle of the night! In an interview, Akimi Yoshida said that Shorter's character design was inspired by Sunplaza Nakano.

Katsu no wa Ore da",1685,https://myanimelist.net/character/4945/Broly,"Broly was the Legendary Super Saiyan born in more than a thousand years. At birth, he had an unusually high level of strength for a Saiyan. Broly's exceptional gifts marked him as being the Legendary Super Saiyan. King Vegeta feared this and ordered for his execution. His father, Paragus, begged to spare his life. King Vegeta ended the argument by blasting him. As Broly's execution was carried out both he and his father were left to die. While Paragus barely survived the blast, Broly survived the attempted execution only to grow stronger. On that same day, Frieza acted on his own fear of the Super Saiyan legend and attacks Planet Vegeta. Amid the destruction, Broly encased himself and his father in a powerful shield of energy and escaped. 
  
 As great as Broly's power was, his emotional instability was greater. Fearing Broly's state of mind, Paragus had a scientist create a special control device to keep Broly controlled. Successful in controlling him, Paragus planned to have revenge on King Vegeta's son. When Broly encountered Son Goku, Broly became erratic though he was brought back under control by Paragus. Eventually, Broly overpowered the control device, and fully manifested his powers. No longer under the device's control, he unleashed his fury on Goku, Vegeta, Son Gohan, Future Trunks, and Piccolo, and defeated them all. The Z warriors eventually channeled their energy into Goku, who used the energy for one last powerful blow that seemingly killed Broly. 
  
 Broly survived and entered a Saiyan Space Pod, coincidentally landing on Earth. The crater caused by his landing filled up with water and froze over time, during which he fell into a deep sleep. During this time, Gohan grew up, Son Goten was born and Goku was in the Afterlife. In an adventure to collect the Dragon Balls, Goten, Trunks, and Gohan find themselves in the mountain range where Broly crashed. Broly awakens and Goten, Trunks, Videl, and Gohan became victims to his rampage. It was only after some spiritual help from Goku that they were able to send Broly straight into the sun.

 Ren is, in outward appearances, an extremely nice and polite star; however, he shows his true self whenever he is around Kyouko.

After Ren's encounter with Reino (from Vie Ghoul), it is revealed that ""Tsuruga Ren"" is only a stage name with his real name being Kuon Hizuri.",20-21,,,190 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/59129.jpg

 Zodiac sign: Pisces 
  
 Usami Akihiko is a 28 year old author. He was raised in England until he was 10, and later moved to Japan.  He graduated law school first of his class and is the youngest recipient of the Naomori Award. 
  
 He was a pure-hearted romanticist, as Takahashi Misaki, his love interest says. 
  
 He is extremely popular with his books, but also writes erotic (BL) Yaoi fiction under the pen name Akikawa Yayoi because it allows him to earn money on his fantasies. He is working for the Marukawa Publishing Co., and to his editors, he is known as a writer/author who doesn't meet deadlines. He comes from a rich and wealthy family and has a half-brother called Haruhiko. He first met Hiroki Kamijou in Japan in his secret base. He was a loner back then and always wanted to be alone. He also doesn't talk much because of his family circumstances. 
  
 Akihiko always wanted to have a normal life. He collects toys because it makes him feel like this is what ""normal childhood"" feels like. He named all his teddy bears Suzuki because to him it is the most common name in Japan. (It isn't.) 
  
 His nickname is ""Usagi"", which means ""rabbit"" in Japanese. Usagi has been Misaki's brother's best friend for over ten years, and was secretly in love with Misaki’s brother but never said anything about it. Due to Misaki's grade, Takahiro asks Usagi to become Misaki's tutor and assist him in raising his grades for the college entrance exams. Due to some twist of fate, Takahiro’s company transfers him away and, worried about the becoming of his little brother, Takahiro asks Usagi for Misaki to stay and live with him until he comes back or until Misaki can come live with him in Osaka.

And in helping her he also gets the chance to travel to the human world, somewhere he's always dreamed of going. 
  
 Staz is sometimes viewed by others as having a lazy look about him, though they never do well to underestimate him as he's also very powerful. He has rapid healing abilities, as well as the ability to paralyze weaker demons with his stare, he's able to control humans and alter memories with his saliva, can suck out other demon's magic with his teeth, and can crush someone's heart from afar. He sometimes says things like ""I might be a vampire, but first and foremost i'm me"" and once lost his temper and nearly killed his friend Wolf while they were fighting when he questioned Staz's reasons for helping Fuyumi, and then scoffed at his statement of being himself before being a vampire.

 Sistine is a stunningly beautiful woman with long silver hair and olive-green eyes. She is often seen wearing her school uniform. 
  
 She is also good friends with Rumia, who was taken in by the Fibel family, and does her best to protect and be there for Rumia. 
  
 Sistine Fibel maintains a strict, no-nonsense demeanor personality and often scolds Glenn Radars for his lackadaisical attitude. She initially hates Glenn, believing him to be as incompetent as he looked due to his lack of enthusiasm, however when he started teaching, she reluctantly accepted what a good teacher he was. 
  
 When Sistine was younger she promised her grandfather that she would unravel the mysteries of the Sky Castle. Her grandfather's death fueled her desire for learning and honing her magic skills in order to accomplish that goal.

 Birthday: May 23 (Gemini) 
 Height: 4'11"" (152 cm) 
 Occupation: Student, Waitress 
 Affiliation: Minegahara High School, 1st year 
  
 Tomoe Koga (古賀 朋絵, Koga Tomoe) is one of the main characters of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume Wo Minai series. As a result of Adolescence Syndrome, Tomoe is capable of eliciting simulated future events. 
  
 Tomoe has a solid desire to fit in and avoid being shunned, so she bears unease over her past and why she cares about her social life and status; the latter is why she is usually on her phone. After her experience with Sakuta, she learned not to focus on what others think of her and thanked him for helping her grow as a person. 
  
 During her time in a middle school in Fukuoka, Tomoe was a bumpkin who hung out with an unnoticed group in her class. However, her father was relocated, which forced her to move to Tokyo. Fearing she would be considered uncool and get bullied, she began wearing makeup, styled her hair in a fancy salon, and wore clothes from fashion magazines. She became satisfied with the result.",,,,"4'11"" (152 cm)","Student, Waitress",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/366709.jpg

 Height: 180 cm (5'11"") 
 Blood Type: O 
 Initial Persona: Izanagi 
 Ultimate Persona: Izanagi-no-Okami 
 Weapons: Two-Handed Sword 
  
 The Protagonist is named by the player in the video game, but is given the name Souji Seta in the manga adaptation and Yuu Narukami in the anime. 
  
 He has silver hair with a shape close to a bowl cut. He is depicted as being a distant, but otherwise friendly, loner with a pessimistic outlook on life due to having to move frequently as a result of his parents' changing careers. 
  
 At the beginning of the game, he moves to the countryside to live with his uncle and cousin for a year, and attends Yasogami High School in the same homeroom  class as Chie, Yosuke, and Yukiko. 
  
 The story of Persona 4 begins when the Protagonist meets Igor and Margaret in the Velvet Room, in the form of a limousine driving in a thick fog; the shape of the Velvet Room changes based on its visitor. 
  
 The Protagonist's first Persona, Izanagi of the Fool Arcana, wears a long coat reminiscent of the Japanese bancho and wields the Amenonuhoko, which, in-game, is a spear with a blade resembling a combat knife. This Persona is later transformed into Izanagi-no-Okami of the World arcana, the game's most powerful Persona. 
  
 The Protagonist also has a unique ""wild card"" ability to swap Personas, similar to the main characters of previous Persona games, but without the power of Death at his hand, he cannot use Fusion spells like the Protagonist of Persona 3. 
  
 The characters of the story give the Protagonist titles ""senpai"", ""sensei"", ""leader"", ""partner"", ""big bro"" when directly talking to him, instead of the usual ""you"" or ""him"" like his predecessors. 
  
 The character design of the Protagonist stayed relatively similar from initial conception, with his tone and expressions changing the most.",,,,"180 cm (5'11"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/138009.jpg

 Minako is the fourth member of the Sailor Team to be discovered by Sailor Moon, and serves as the leader of the Guardian Senshi who protect her. She uses love-related powers. In the manga and anime series she dreams of becoming a famous idol, whereas in the live-action series her character is refactored to already be a celebrity. 
  
 Silly or serious, Minako consistently displays great confidence, enthusiasm, and leadership skill. She is the ""owner"" of Artemis, the white guardian cat who introduced her to her life as a Senshi. He lives in her home (as Luna lives in Usagi's) and is one of her closest friends.

 Height: 175 cm (5'8.5"") 
 Weight: 62 kg (136.4 lbs) 
 Specialty: sculptures 
  
 Morita occupies room 203, his floormates being Takemoto and Hasegawa. Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto. 
  
 Morita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse. Morita's obsession with Hagu stems from a fondness of cute things during his childhood, such as causing a cat to become neurotic after cuddling it too much.",24,,,"175 cm (5'8.5"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/34899.jpg

 Makoto Kino, called Lita Kino in the original English dub, is a fourteen-year-old girl who is a student in Usagi Tsukino's class and was rumoured to have been expelled from her previous school for fighting. Unusually tall and strong for a Japanese schoolgirl, she transforms into Sailor Jupiter, the Guardian of Thunder and Courage. Both of Makoto's parents died in a plane crash years ago, so she lives alone and takes care of herself. She cultivates her physical strength and domestic interests, including housekeeping cooking, and gardening. Makoto excels at hand-to-hand combat. Her dream is to marry a young handsome man and to own a flower-and-cake shop.

 Birthday: 13th September 
 Zodiac sign: Virgo 
  
 Mei is an honor student, the chairman's granddaughter, and student council president. She is stern, cold, and often calm and composed, but she can be rather sensitive and mature to some extent. At first, there is little to know about her and a bad impression of Mei washes over Yuzu, which causes Yuzu to take interest on Mei later on. Though Mei seems to be hard to approach, she is rather sensitive and lonely which makes Yuzu want to care for Mei more.

1083,"Okajima, Rokurou(岡島 緑郎)",Black LagoonBlack Lagoon: The Second BarrageBlack Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail,1627,https://myanimelist.net/character/459/Rokurou_Okajima,"Rokurou Okajima, also known as ""Rock,"" is the protagonist of the series. He was a Japanese salaryman for Asahi Industries in Tokyo until he was taken hostage by the crew of the Black Lagoon. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief, Kageyama, abandoned him in an attempt to cover up the smuggling operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a humble and mild-mannered person despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the barbarity of the Southeast Asian crime world. He still wears his tie, short-sleeved dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing Stockholm syndrome. 
  
 Within the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in geology. He is also a skilled linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese (his native language) and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including Spanish, Romanian and Russian. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol, owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's earnest personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan ""Jackpot"" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace, whom he trusts to the greatest degree. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more jaded teammates and as a bright spot in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them. 
  
 Rock is one of the ""luckiest"" characters in the series as he managed to survive every single thing he experienced from being taken hostage to being shot at. Thus far, he has survived the wrath of Revy, Balalaika, Roberta, and Sawyer. He is personally appointed by Mr. Chang to help Garcia Lovelace, much to Lagoon Company's disapproval. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption. Later, in a conversation with Fabiola, he demonstrates a darker, sadistically ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and the Roanapur environment. Benny even points out that there are things about him that scare almost everyone in Roanapur. 
  
 While Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not seem to have much connection to them due to their somewhat apathetic attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the Showa period, according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975-1976.

 He is first in 10th grade for best grades. He is in love with Hikari, but she is too dense to notice it. Although he doesn't come straight out and admit it, it is common knowledge among the SA that he loves her, and Kei himself also doesn't deny it. The reason he hasn't confessed his love to her or asked her out is because he figured, knowing her, she'd probably just laugh it off (yes, for all her intellectual excellence, she is quite stupid/naive/innocent when it comes to love). 
  
 Although he is stoic most of the time and always keeps a calm facade under any circumstance, things involving Hikari are the only ones that bring out intense anxiety within him. It bothers him whenever Hikari pushes herself too hard, although it is for this very reason that he admires and respects her. 
  
 His birthday is on November 22nd.

Extremely self-centered, she thinks nothing of manipulating others for her pleasure. 
  
 Little is known of Tomie's true background, not even her family name. It is not known how she gained her powers, or even if she was aware of them prior to 1986. According to witnesses, she aged normally to that point, and seemed a standard if very pretty and flirtatious girl. On a field trip to Inariyawa, a small mountain near her school, Tomie was pressuring a teacher she'd been having sex with to leave his wife and marry her, when a male classmate who'd become obsessed with Tomie accosted her. She taunted the boy, and in the ensuing scuffle, Tomie fell over a cliff. Believing Tomie dead, the teacher decided to cover up the accident by chopping up the girl's body with the aid of the boys of the class. It turned out she wasn't quite dead, so this became a particularly gruesome task. The class then scattered the body parts where they would, in theory, not be found. 
  
 Some parts were found, identified as Tomie's, and cremated. Her death was blamed on a psychopath, and a funeral was held. Which made it rather a shock when Tomie walked into class the next day as if nothing had happened. Her reappearance drove the more susceptible members of the class to madness, and when two of them tried to go to the police, the others turned violent in an attempt to stop them. Tomie disappeared shortly thereafter. 
  
 Tomie then began appearing in widely separated locations around Japan, inspiring men to passion and murder. She apparently died several more times, but always turned up alive again. Due to the police's stubborn refusal to credit these stories, no concerted effort was made to capture Tomie at least until 1995.

With her close friends and family she is a sweet, gentle, young woman with a great warmth and spirit. She tends to be independent, having been alone and taking care of herself for quite some time. Hotaru grew up very much alone, sick, and an outcast, shunned by her classmates who were frightened of her. It was not until she met Chibi-Usa that she at last had a true friend.

1103,Roberta(ロベルタ),Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood TrailBlack Lagoon OmakeBlack Lagoon,1590,https://myanimelist.net/character/2762/Roberta,"Roberta is a maid who worked for four years at the Lovelace household in Colombia. Although her domestic skills, such as cleaning and cooking, were poor, she has developed a close friendship with the young scion of the Lovelace family, Garcia. Roberta was once known as Rosarita Cisneros, a former FARC guerrilla trained as an assassin in Cuba and an internationally wanted criminal. She earned the moniker ""Bloodhound of Florencia"" for her relentless drive to achieve her objectives. 
  
 In combat, Roberta is a truly fearsome opponent, having trained in a wide variety of martial, stealth, and weapon skills. Among the weapons she has used before were a sniper rifle, a combat knife, a shotgun disguised as an umbrella, a machine gun which was disguised as a briefcase, a grenade launcher, spiked brass knuckles, a trench spike, and pistols. Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost supernatural levels. An example being Roberta chasing down Lagoon company's getaway car and holding on by driving her knife into the rear of the car, nearly pulling the muscular Dutch out from his car, and accurately fire a large caliber sniper rifle from the hip with one arm. 
  
 It is ironic that while Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in the story of Black Lagoon, she is also humane, possessing warmth, kindness, remorse, and family love for her master and his son. 
  
 She admitted that she did murder children, women or anyone in name of revolution during her FARC years. Disillusioned by the fact that she is merely a tool for drug cartels in cahoots with FARC in the end, she opted out and joined the Lovelace clan as a maid. Despite being asked by Garcia not to pick up gunfighting anymore, later events of manga story make her go into battle again, seeking revenge. 
  
 She is also heavily modeled on El Mariachi, popularized by Antonio Banderas down to suitcase machine gun signature and her Latin America background.

 The protagonist of City Hunter. Ryou is a combat expert, having fought as a guerrilla in numerous conflicts alluded to throughout the series, and has a long history of working in the underground. He carries a Colt Python. His mysterious past starts with him being the only survivor of a plane crash in Central America as a toddler. The crash left him an orphan in a rebel village during a civil war, prompting him to learn to fight at a young age. As a result, he has very little information on his true parentage, or even his birthdate. (Later, Kaori Makimura unilaterally declared March 26 his birthday, as that was the day they first met). After the war he ended up in the United States, where he worked as a hired gun, but eventually he found his way to Tokyo, Japan. There he formed the ""City Hunter"" team with Hideyuki Makimura (Kaori's brother), and it's sometime after that where the manga/TV series' timeline begins. 
  
 One of Ryou's most striking traits as a character is his extreme sexual excitability. Especially in the manga, where, as Saeba himself often notes, he experiences an erection every time he sees or even thinks about something sexual. As a result of this, he constantly flirts with, tries to seduce, or even literally harasses most of the female characters he finds sexy. Even with those whom he knows and respects well, to the point of refusing to take orders from men unless their request touches something in his soul. And while he can always pull himself together and take things seriously when needed, various adaptations often downplay this trait of his to still exaggerated, but more tame dimensions.

She is accompanied by an elf, Evarella. She aided Guts's group with a troll infestation in the nearby village Enoch, where she showed how powerful magic can be in Berserk. 
  
 After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions. 
  
 Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense ""Od"" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts. 
  
 As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Their journey together constantly brings them into even deeper understanding.

It turns out that anyone can use Excalibur. However, no one can put up with its personality (it has a bigger ego than Black Star). The only reason that those who use it are called heroes is that they can put up with its annoying habits, such as a list of one-thousand things he demands to be completed, such as daily five-hour reading sessions. Excalibur was first introduced when Kid and Black Star found a book about him and thus sought him out, only to discover that the book had in fact been written by Excalibur himself. They quickly ditched him due to his personality. His other form is completely the opposite given his elegant weapon form, looking like a cartoon-ish gentlemen with an outrageous mustache and no pants. On the other hand, his legendary powers have been proven by a fellow Shibusen student who found completing the appointed tasks easy. Excalibur can grant great power, light speed, and teleportation, and the wielder can easily defeat three of Shibusen's strongest combined. In the end, Excalibur was put back again because the student could not put up with his annoying sneeze. His existence throughout the story is purely comical, with the exception of the fact of how he informed Kid, the Thompsons, Buttataki, and Blair about the story of Eibon, backed by Shinigami.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/524074.jpg

 Occupation: S-Class Mage, Fairy Tail Head Waitress 
  
 Mirajane is the cover girl or drawing point of Fairy Tail. She is 19 years old, an S-class mage, model to Sorcerer Magazine, and the older sister of Elfman and Lisanna. When Mirajane was an S-class mage, she was known as ""The Demon."" However, due to a past incident involving the death of her younger sister, Lisanna, Mirajane somehow lost much of her magical ability and her will to fight. Given the recent event of Elfman regaining his lost abilities and Mirajane's increased confidence, Mirajane may someday regain her abilities and move forward with her life. 
  
 Mirajane plays a motherly role within the guild, and is often seen running the bar at the guild hall. She has rarely been shown to be in a bad mood, and can tolerate all of the guild's eccentricities. However, there have been a couple incidents that have disturbed Mirajane, including her discovery of the stealing of an S-Class job by Natsu, Happy and Lucy, and her later disappointment with Laxus following the destruction of the guild building. When she was younger, she was also very bold, brash, and temperamental, more specifically to her comrade Erza. She was described as infamous amongst guilds and criminals alike. However, this changed after her younger sisters death. 
  
 Mirajane got her name from an online video game Hiro Mashima was playing while he created her.

He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D has surprising power and resourcefulness, possessing most of the strengths and only mild levels of vampiric weaknesses. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a ""normal"" human, though marked by his unearthly beauty and powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by humans. His only notable weaknesses are that he is, while not unfeeling, emotionally remote but sometimes sentimental. He is also (far more rarely than other dhampirs) randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years. Otherwise, D does not suffer from vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, possessing an imposing supernatural aura to his opponents and godlike reflexes surpassing even vampires.

 Oskar von Reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Wolfgang Mittermeyer, Reinhard's ablest field commander. 
  
 Reuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. Reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. Since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother's adultery. His mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. Reuenthal's father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected. 
  
 Reuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. While stationed in fortress Iserlohn, he met Wolfgang Mittermeyer and the two became close friends. Mittermeyer is probably the only person Reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. When Mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, Reuenthal didn't hesitate to pledge his loyalty to Reinhard in return for his help with Mittermeyer's case. 
  
 Reuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to Reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but Reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for Mittermeyer's soothing presence in his life. His problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. Proud and ambitious Reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards Reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. His flagship is the Tristan.

 Age: 16 
 Eye Color: Blue 
 Height: 160 cm 
 Weight: 57 kg 
  
 Sumireko Sanshokuin, sometimes called by her nickname Pansy (三色菫), is a main character in Oresuki. She is a second year High School student and a helper in the school library. 
  
 Pansy looks like an unattractive gloomy bookworm with long black hair tied in braids, thick glasses and a sharp tongue towards Joro. Beneath her unappealing exterior, she is in fact a gorgeous beauty with a bust size far larger than she typically shows. 
  
 Pansy presents herself as an authentic and common person yet an individual with strong charisma and observation. From her perspectives and experiences, she shows herself to be a well-mannered smooth-talker with good advice and a level head, as well as a lovable beauty queen. She appears as a strong person with powerful enthusiasm, but she does show fear at the thought of being with her stalkers. 
  
 She is polite to her peers at school, only turning a sharp tongue at Joro. After she makes friends with Himawari, Cosmos and Sun, she shows that she is very kind and considerate to people close to her. 
  
 Pansy was pushed into dating Hose in middle school, and she moved away to get away from him, as well as vowed to never keep her true feelings hidden and clash with them head-on once she’s become a high schooler (which trouble Joro the most). She sees that Joro is very similar to Hose and she aims to prevent him from becoming like Hose by giving him affection, as well as forcing him to face his shortcomings such as his inferiority complex.

 Zodiac sign: Leo 
  
 Smart, attractive, athletic and talented, Yukino Miyazawa appears to be the model student. Both her male and female peers express their admiration for her, often asking her for help and commenting about her model features and characteristics. However, her ""perfect"" exterior hides the fact that everything she does is done solely to receive praise from others. She has been this way since she was a little girl—a self-professed ""queen of vanity""—Yukino once practiced playing her recorder until she vomited blood. With all this praise, however, she never realized that she never had a real friend aside from her family and was considered by her peers as a kind of semi-approachable ""guest."" This all changes when Yukino meets Soichiro Arima, another model student who beats her high school entrance exam score, and is even more popular and athletic than Yukino. 
  
 Yukino is envious of her rival Soichiro, and works hard to top his grades. When Soichiro confesses that he has a crush on her, she rejects him and laughs about it afterwards. But her observant sister Kano points out that Yukino's rivalry with him is born of admiration. This revelation is useless, however, as Yukino accidentally lets her guard down and Soichiro discovers that she is a slob at home. Soichiro uses this to blackmail her to spend more time with her.

 The princess of the human kingdom. Kidnapped by the Demon King, she spends her days waiting for the heroes to rescue her. At least, that's how it was supposed to be... 
  
 Soon after being taken as a hostage, Suya makes the most out of her situation by pilfering different objects to make her life easier (at the expense of the demons' peace of mind). Initially acting quite selfishly, the longer her stay at the Demon Castle extends, the more Suya finds herself caring about its citizens and taking more interest in the political relations between the human and demon kingdoms. 
  
 Although others tend to see and treat her as a child, Suya is actually an adult. Despite her tendency to laze around, she is very meticulous, efficient and focused when it comes to doing her work as a royal princess, and it is implied that she seldom got time to rest while living in the human kingdom. As evidenced by the various objects she builds herself, Suya is also quite handy and resourceful.

 Location: Z-City 
 Abilities: Superhuman Speed, Agility 
 Weapons: Ninja equipment 
 Occupation: Bodyguard (former), Villain 
 Affiliation: Zeniru (former) 
  
 Sonic is a villain, first appearing as a bodyguard hired by Zeniru. He views Saitama as his eternal rival. 
  
 Sonic is a thin, slightly effeminate man, who despite his slender build is extremely strong and fast. He has black medium length hair that is tied up in a topknot. One noticeable feature is that he has two purple marks under his eyes, one under each. He first appears wearing a tight black outfit highlighted by metal plating on the shins, fore-arms, shoulders and chest, as well as a long purple scarf. He is shown later in black street clothes. He always carries a ninjato and other ninja equipment such as kunai and ninja stars. 
  
 Sonic is a villain who, despite his normally calm appearance, loves fighting strong opponents as shown by when he gets a ""child-like smile"" on his face when he first meets Saitama and has two of his attacks blocked, earlier calling this his ""bad habit."" He seems to be very quick to act as he attacks Saitama on their first meeting without letting him explain the situation. 
  
 After being defeated by Saitama for the first time (episode 4), while working as a bodyguard for Zeniru, he devotes his time into finding a way to defeat him.

 Height: 166 cm (5' 5"") 
 Weight: 56 kg (123 lbs) 
 BWH: 87/58/88 
 Rank: Low-class Devil 
 Role: Knight 
 Race: Reincarnated Devil (Former Human) 
 Weapon: Excalibur Destruction (Volume 3), Ascalon (shared with Issei), Ex-Durandal 
  
 Xenovia first appears in Volume 3 along with Irina under the order of the Church to retrieve the three stolen Excalibur swords. She and Irina formed a temporary alliance with Issei, Koneko, Yuuto, and Saji, in which they would retrieve the stolen Excaliburs fragments but would allow Yuuto to destroy one of them. During the fight with Freed Sellzen and Valper Galilei, she reveals herself to be the wielder of Durandal, and quickly turns the tide of battle by destroying the fused Excalibur and cutting down Freed. Following the battle with the Fallen Angel leader Kokabiel, she became a Devil under Rias after finding out that God died. 
  
 When Xenovia was first introduced, she was portrayed as an individual with a quiet and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She also prefers not to get involved in problems that do not concern her. While a faithful member of the Church, her beliefs are flexible enough to accept help from a Dragon such as receiving a free lunch (after Irina spent all their money on a fake painting of a Saint), and wanting to not only accomplish their mission, but survive afterwards as well. After Volume 3, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they previously met. Like Asia, as a person who was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school. 
  
 As a Knight, Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds, which, combined with the destructive powers of Durandal, makes her a formidable fighter. She also has the ability to tap into Durandal's holy aura with other swords, evident when she uses it with Issei's Ascalon (Issei allows her to use it since he is not a good swordsman and because she cannot fully control Durandal).",,,,"166 cm (5' 5"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/279781.jpg

 Mayumi is a young lady who is known for her natural beauty. It is stated during her internal monologue that she stopped growing (height) in her third year of middle school, which makes her slightly shorter than average. Her limbs are described as quite long despite her short stature, and her chest is also large in proportion to her height.

 Considered to be a prodigy in the magic community, she is nicknamed the ""Elven Sniper"" for her extraordinary talents in long-ranged precision shooting.

She was one of the ""Triumvirate"", the three strongest third year students at First High School, which also includes other notable students such as Katsuto Juumonji and Mari Watanabe. 
  
 Excluding her height, Mayumi is described as someone with a well-rounded personality and a feminine side. While it is hard to notice, she cares about others in her own unique way, so she fits the bill of being an ""older sister"" perfectly. She is generally quite confident in her appearance when in the presence of others.

She was horrified when she discovered Kokonotsu's natural talent would go to waste so she struck a bargain with his father: if she could convince Kokonotsu to become the head of the store, then his father would immediately join her father's company.

  From : Yugakure, the Village Hidden in the Steam 
  Weapon : 3-headed Scythe 
  Partner : Kakuzu 
  Religion : Jashin-ism 
  
 Because he is a member of the Jashin religion, Hidan has immortality. This immortality will end, however, if he does not regularly sacrifice people to Jashin. This is a religion that worships a deity of the same name and where anything less than death and utter destruction is considered a sin. His religion's experiments have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent's blood and then drawing Jashin's triangular-design on the ground, Hidan can create a voodoo doll-like link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan's body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Because he is immortal, Hidan is not impaired while doing this, instead finding pleasure in the pain it causes him. 
  
 Hidan is sadistic, arrogant, rude, and impatient. All qualities which his partner, Kakuzu, finds annoying. He and his partner, Kakuzu, fight and argue constantly, so it might be a wonder why they are put on the same team.  Kakuzu actually commented that he and Hidan made the perfect team, because even thought Kakuzu has the urge to kill Hidan often, he is unable to due to his partner's immortality. Because Kakuzu is considered immortal as well, their own fellow Akatsuki member, Kisame Hoshigake, jokingly referred to the team as the ""Zombi Combi"".  Hidan likes to annoy the other members of the Akatsuki, and even refers to them by insulting nicknames, such as ""Dei-chan"". He dislikes Pain's authority over him and openly challenges him in front of others. Hidan's aggressiveness is the reason he left his village, where he was frustrated by the peace and lack of violence, before leaving he slaughtered many of his neighbours in cold-blood for entertainment.",,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/2792/Hidan: 'src'

 Haruka is a stubborn, protective individual, but is also strong-willed, capable, charming, and occasionally even doting. She is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Neptune in the final episode of Sailor Moon R. When transformed, she is known as Sailor Uranus, and is part of the group known in Fanon as the Outer Senshi. 
  
 Haruka is a race car driver, even though she is barely sixteen years old when she appears. However, the timing of her birthday to the Japanese school year means she is one grade ahead of the Inner Senshi.

Along with her four friends, they created an animation titled ""Shinbutsu Konkou Shichifukujin,"" which was to be shown at their high school's cultural festival. During production, everyone played their roles in order to complete the project. However, it is revealed that Aoi is not the greatest at drawing, computer graphics, script writing, or voice acting. Before graduation, the girls made a promise to reunite one day and create another anime altogether. They set this creed in stone by sharing donuts. It seems that everyone has their minds set on what they want to pursue in the anime industry. As for Aoi, she graduated without a specific goal in mind, and came to Musashino Animation to work as a production assistant, immediately getting involved in her first anime, Exodus! 
  
 After her first year as a production assistant at Musashino Animation, the company is hired to work on an anime adaptation for a manga titled ""The Third Girl Aerials Squad."" At this time, Aoi is promoted by director Seiichi Kinoshita to her new position as Head Production Assistant after her colleague, Yutaka Honda, resigned from the company to pursue his dreams. This deals a great amount of pressure on Aoi, as she is immediately overwhelmed by the tasks involved in her position. 
  
 Aoi seems to have a bright and cheerful personality and she always strives to stay positive, no matter how murky the problem. She is also hardworking and cares a lot for her friends and always tries to stay calm in stressful situations, and she is also a very energetic girl. 
  
 Although a fresh face at Musashino Animation, she quickly learns how to cope with the everyday stresses of her job. Her diligence and determination to find a solution to every predicament has garnered the respect of many of her colleagues and acquaintances in the industry, alike. She is very persistent and patient when caught in between predicaments at work.

 Rin appears to be a tomboy due to playing sports and not wearing a skirt when she was a child. She mostly teases Koizumi Hanayo and appears to be with her most of the time. Her personality is similar to Kousaka Honoka's because they're both determined and hard-working. She usually ends her sentences with nyan~! (Meow). In addition, she sometimes acts like a cat and does the signature curved mouth look. Despite acting like a cat, Rin is, ironically, allergic to cats. Hanayo and Rin once found a stray cat but could not adopt it due to Rin's allergies. 
  
 Rin is great at sports, and is skilled in hurdling, football, and basketball. She enjoys dance very much and is the current practice leader of μ's. Her special skill is her sharp nose, which is almost on par with a dog's.

 Specialties: Pitching, mental calculations 
 Techniques: Iga's ""Kira"" (伊賀「気羅」) 
  
 A 16-year-old ninja in the Kairōshū who uses the forbidden technique ""kira"". This technique shoots the user's ki into the body of a target and controls it from the inside out, which can cause the target's bones to break or their body to completely explode. The cost of using this technique is the loss of the user's life force, gradually losing their five senses and eventually dying. According to volume 4, he has roughly two more months to live. He appears to be very sensitive, as he used the kira technique and almost killed a delivery man just because he called him a ""cute kid"". He is also shown to eat at a rapid pace. After first abducting Miharu and taking him to an abandoned train car, Yoite tells Miharu his friends will die from the ki he implanted inside them; unless Miharu utilizes the Shinrabanshō to grant his wish, to be ""erased"" from existence. This turns out to be a lie, but Miharu still aims to grant the wish.

Friend of Akihisa from 1st year. 
  
 Hideyoshi is one of the rare people with normal minds in Class F, but because of that he is often pressured by his classmates. According to his grandpa, Hideyoshi is an owner of an unbelievable beauty, so much that he is often called a girl―but really, he is a fine man. His loveliness even nominated him in the list of 'Guys who would look good in girl's outfit', sponsored by the Journalism club, but he was eventually dropped from the ranking for being 'unfair'. Because of his appearance, girls often forget his real gender, leaving Akihisa as the only one who recognizes him as a guy (though sometimes even Akihisa forgets this). In training camps, for the safety of his own and the others, he is given a private separate dressing room and bathroom. In school, there is a rumor that Hideyoshi is actually of the 3rd gender, dubbed ""Hideyoshi"". As with Akihisa's case, Hideyoshi's photos are secretly sold and bought―the price of his photo being 5 times higher than photos of Akihisa in girl outfits. He feels regretful for not being treated as a guy by many. However, given that he blushes his face when treated as a girl by Akihisa, delights when called a fool's friend, puts in tackles that are subtly off the point―it seems he doesn't hate it so much either. Therefore, this person is also not exactly normal. 
  
 He takes part in the Drama club and his speciality is vocal mimicry―be that a girl's or a boy's voice. Even though he is often not too willing to act, once a situation occurs, he perfectly deals with his given role, thanks to his excessive drama spirit. Part of the reason why he is in Class F is because he too absorbed into drama and couldn't keep up the grades. It seems he is especially weak in Classic Literature. 
  
 In contrast to his lovely outlook, he has an extremely strong stomach ('Steel Stomach' as called by himself) that can even take in a potato seed. However, even such stomach cannot stand against Mizuki's mighty lunch. 
  
 His name originates from 'Toyotomi Hideyoshi' and his old name 'Kinoshita Toukichirou'. 
  
 His shoukanjuu (summoned beast)'s equipments are blue pants and Naginata. Occult version is Nekomata (ghost cat girl), obviously influenced from the nature 'Cuteness'. 
  
 Hideyoshi is ranked 1st in Male Characters and 10th in Female Characters of the 2009 version of ""Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! (このライトノベルがすごい!)"", scoring a cumulative 2nd place from all characters.

Katsu no wa Ore da,1437,https://myanimelist.net/character/2707/Trunks,"Trunks is the Human and Saiyan hybrid son of Bulma and Vegeta, and later the older brother of Bulla. 
  
 As a child during the Majin Buu arc, Trunks is shown to be quite cocky and stingy just like his father, as well as mischievous, most likely due to the fact that this Trunks grew up with his father Vegeta and enjoyed the luxuries of peace, while Future Trunks grew up without Future Vegeta and in an apocalyptic world, causing him to be much more serious and cautious. Trunks has a combination of both of his parents' personalities: cocky and proud like his father and spoiled and selfish like his mother. 
  
 In his later years, Trunks adopts a personality similar to his future counterpart's. During and in between his battles at the World Martial Arts Tournament, he acts just like his father does, calm when he fights and insulting his opponents.

Megami-sama!: Chichaitte Koto wa Benri da ne,1429,https://myanimelist.net/character/756/Belldandy,"Belldandy is unflinchingly kind, patient, and warm, not only to Keiichi but to everyone, without exception. However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power. 
  
 Belldandy's capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, ""see"" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and ""speak"" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, ""rampage"" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself. 
  
 Belldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless餠Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus. 
  
 Belldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth's work at the Earth Assistance Agency.

Part of the reason for this misunderstanding is the trendy punk clothing her mother buys for her as well as the way in which she expresses her shyness and avoids doing new things.

 He lost his memory during a brain washing program. At first he thinks he is a terrorist. He met Saki in Washington D.C., being naked and only carrying a gun and a cellphone.

He has a very modern cell phone with the phrase ""noblesse oblige"" printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit. When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be Juiz answers. After she sent him a map with the place where he was supposed to go he finds, in his apartment, guns and many different passports which seemed to all belong to him (after his arrival in Japan, Juiz told him that he has to use up all his digital money). Then he met the girl named Saki and they return to Japan together. According to his passport, he lives in Japan, Toyosu, his name is Akira Takizawa and he was born on January 7, 1989 and since the series takes place in 2010 he is, therefore, 21 years old.

 Likes: likes sweet things 
 Love interest: Miyano Yoshikazu 
 Sexuality: Not confirmed, has a preference for both genders. 
  
 Initially, Sasaki is introduced as a bright and cheerful, if overly eager, upperclassman; however, this is not necessarily the whole picture. He can be rash and impulsive, acting or speaking without thinking of the consequences or the people around him. Though he does have some friends, Sasaki is something of a loner. In flashbacks, with his family, or when he is alone he is usually shown to be gloomy and quiet, often repeating the phrase ""it's annoying."" 
  
 Sasaki Shuumei is one of the two eponymous main characters of Sasaki and Miyano. While he has a reputation as a bad boy, he is very affectionate toward Miyano Yoshikazu and enjoys spending time with him. He is dating Miyano Yoshikazu.

 Sango is youkai slayer (""youkai taijiya"") who hails from a village of professional yōkai slayers. The only member of Inuyasha's group to have no supernatural powers, Sango instead wields the Hiraikotsu, a massive boomerang made of yōkai bones, in addition to a broad repertoire of tools and tricks for battling yōkai. Sango is also a victim of Naraku's evil schemes; her family was killed and her entire village destroyed by Naraku's yōkai so that Naraku could then blame Inuyasha and manipulate Sango into trying to kill him. When that ploy failed, Naraku used a shard of the Shikon Jewel to revive and control her little brother Kohaku, forcing him to fight Inuyasha and company, and using him as a means by which to manipulate Sango. She seeks vengeance against Naraku, but her primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku's influence and somehow save his life, although currently it's uncertain if she will be able to do so as Kohaku's life is tied to the jewel shard. She has obvious feelings towards Miroku, although she is offended by his constant groping and lechery. (""Sango"" means ""coral"")

 Zodiac sign: Aries 
 Height: 174 cm (5'8½"") 
 Weight: 54kg (119 lbs) 
 Occupation: 12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute 
  
 Mayuri Kurotsuchi is Captain of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13 and 2nd president of the Shinigami Research Institute. He gained his position after Kisuke Urahara, the former captain and president, was sentenced into exile by Soul Society. His lieutenant is Nemu Kurotsuchi, his artificially-created ""daughter."" 
  
 Mayuri's appearance has a very skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. In the anime, Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and yellow eyes when unmasked. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed. 
  
 Mayuri's left arm can extend out like a grappling hook. Mayuri is able to pull out part of his ear, which is Scythe like weapon attached to his body. He is able to blend himself with the environment with some sort of covering that flakes away once he reveals himself. 
  
 Mayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself. He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into human bombs in an attempt to capture Uryū Ishida and Orihime Inoue for experimentation. He also withheld vital information about the Bount from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself. 
  
 It is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, while he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in Seiretei Communication. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled ""Effective Medication for the Brain,"" which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly it is highly popular among the readers. 
  
 In battle Mayuri likes to play with his opponent torturing little by little until they can hardly stand.",,,,"174 cm (5'8½"")","12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/73295.jpg

 After being bullied for his unusual name at a young age, Nasa Yuzaki wanted people to respect his name, rather than laugh at its uniqueness. He decided that in order to make that happen, he felt he needed to study harder than anyone else. Through this, he somewhat achieves his goal. 
  
 He marries Tsukasa after she saves his life in chapter 1. Although he is shown to be somewhat pervy, he is a very good partner to Tsukasa. 
  
 Nasa is an extremely organized person. He states a few times that ""even if [his] house were to burn down, it would be okay"", as all of his possessions are either digital or replaceable.

He is a cocky, ambitious warlord who tends to speak in a mixture of English and Japanese. He usually wields a single katana, but can store and fight with six swords at once (three in each hand, held between the fingers). He is also depicted in a rivalry with Sanada Yukimura. 
  
 (Source: Wikipedia) 
  
 Off the battlefield, Date's demeanor is surprisingly quiet, mild and thoughtful. He discusses plans and difficulties openly with his men and often weighs the counsel of his second in command, Kojuurou Katakura, before making major decisions. This inner personality contrast adds to his character's appeal. Also, his loyalty to his men is unmistakable.

 Capital: London 
 Language: English 
 Birthday: April 23 
 National flower: Rose 
 Height: 5'9 (177 cm) 
  
 Human name: Arthur Kirkland 
 Height: 175cm (5'9"") 
 Age: 23 (appearance) 
  
 More commonly referred to as ""England"" or ""Britain"", he's a rainy island with the reputation as being the ""delinquent of Europe"". As a kid he was quite violent, and grew up to be a pirate. However, he's hung up his pirate hat and has gone from being a swashbuckling bad boy to a self-proclaimed ""gentleman."" 
  
 Since long ago, he's been on bad terms with France. Both have done terrible things to one another, the most notable in the Hetalia series (on England's part) being when England's army burned Jeanne d'Arc at the stake. A teenage France used to pick on a young England back in the day, but their little squabbles and arguments (even in present times) are usually and have been over extremely petty issues. Despite this, they seem to have an underlying respect for one another and spend every Christmas together as shown in the comics. England also allowed France to 'conquer him when they thought the world was ending, something which France had always dreamed of. They are also shown to be quite close to each other, even if they do bicker often, France being one of the Englishman's closest friends (even if he'll deny it.) 
  
 He raised America as a child after fighting over him with France and Finland. The two were like brothers, but England insisted that America not refer to him as such (the unpleasant memories of his own brothers haunted him). Due to America declaring his independence and fighting against him, their relationship was spoiled. Apparently, on every 4th of July (America's Independence Day) since then, he becomes ill and heartbroken. In present times, the two are always butting heads over something, but deep down, they both care for each other. 
  
 Although America was like a brother to him, he does have actual blood brothers; Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who have yet to be profiled, were mentioned to hate his guts, going so far as to throw rocks at him, mail curses to him, and shoot arrows at him to keep him away from them. His youngest brother is Sealand, who also seems to hate him, calling him ""Jerk England."" Even so, England does care for him (though is usually annoyed and frustrated with him and his antics). 
  
 His personality is rather cynical, stubborn, sarcastic, competitive, and cold, even though he claims to be a gentleman. He has a sharp tongue and a potty mouth, but is not a bad person. He's also described as being a tsundere. When he becomes friends with someone, he is surprisingly very loyal to them. France noted him once as having a slender build. England has a strong belief in the supernatural and the occult; he can even perform black magic, see supernatural creatures, and is able to converse with said creatures (such as unicorns, ghosts, fairies, and even on some accounts, a flying bunny and Captain Hook). However, he refuses to believe in aliens. His hobbies include embroidery and other craftsmanship, drinking tea, getting drunk, literature, rock/punk music, and criticizing America's movies. He also loves to cook, but a running gag throughout the entire series is that he sucks at it and that his food has no taste whatsoever (which is why America, who grew up eating his food, is able to eat the strange ""delicacies"" that he does). When drunk, he becomes violent and bitter, often complaining or raving on about America in his drunken state. 
  
 His most noticeable feature are his thick, bushy eyebrows. During his pirate days, he used to set up colonies everywhere (and torment the heck out of Spain). It appears as though all of his colonies (that have been personified so far) possess the same bushy eyebrows (examples being Hong Kong, Wy, and Australia). 
  
 Although he officially represents the United Kingdom as a whole, among his brothers Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, he is supposed to represent England. Through the Hetalia series, he's also referred to as ""England"" on numerous accounts (even though Hidekaz Himaruya stated that to the other countries of the world, he is simply ""United Kingdom""), which most of the general fandom is familiar with. The English dubbed version of the anime adaptation refers to him as ""Britain,"" something that, according to the company, was a request from the original Japanese producers.

 Mikazuki is a calm and collected individual with a head for the big picture. He has an easygoing personality and is devoted to his comrades. He is cold-blooded to his enemies, fighting them, particularly Gjallarhorn, without any sense of honor. He is deeply loyal to his friend Orga Itsuka and steadfastly follows any order or request without question. 
  
 On the other hand, due to his background as a child soldier, he has difficulty interacting with people outside of Tekkadan and has a limited understanding of girls and relationships.

 Mikazuki is the most experienced and the most capable mobile worker operator in CGS, thus he was assigned to pilot the Gundam Barbatos. He has received the Alaya-Vijnana System surgical treatment three times and survived. In mobile suit combat, Mikazuki prefers to fight in close range and is often seen using mace-type weapons. Although he has also used swords, guns, and cannons when required. Mikazuki can be reckless at times and has no qualms wrecking his Barbatos during battle. His excellent mobile suit piloting skills eventually earned him the nickname ""Devil.""

 Height: at least 180 cm (5""11) 
 Birthday: March 21 
  
 Wakana is quite tall for his age, standing at least 180 centimeters. When Marin asked him his height, he was interrupted before he could finish saying, meaning that he may be taller than 180cm. He has short, black hair and gray eyes, along with a tiny mole on the outer lower corner of his right eye. 
  
 Outside of his school uniform, he is always wearing a samue, a general work outfit consisting of a blue suit jacket and pants, with a simple white shirt underneath. He wears wooden sandals and wears a white headband while working. He tends to have it over his shoulders when not wearing his headband. 
  
 At the start of the series, Wakana was a withdrawn person in high school, having no friends and a secret love and admiration for hina dolls.His solitary attitude makes him rather submissive with others. Wakana is rather shy and modest, not doing well with embarrassing or lewd topics. Wakana doesn't appear to have much of a life outside of his grandfather's store and helping Marin, as he always wears his work attire outside of his school uniform, and often spends his free time either sewing or painting hina doll faces.

 Like many others in Nazarick, Narberal views humans as low-class creatures. The only human exempt from her contempt is the lastborn of Pleiades. Though she does not particularly enjoy killing humans, she will not hesitate to do so if there's no reason to let them live. This nature makes her one of the two, along with Solution Epsilon, ""extremely dangerous"" Pleiades. 
  
 As a created NPC of Nazarick, she is extremely loyal to Momonga and proud of her quest to support him close by. Nevertheless, she does not understand Momonga's purpose to become a hero very well, so she does not hide her aggressive attitude towards humans and often refers to Momonga's alias Ainz with ""-sama,"" even when the two masquerade as adventurers. 
  
 In the web novel version, Narberal is also a doppelganger, though she used illusion magic to become the adventurer named Momon. Also in that version, she was created by Nishikienrai.

 Birthday: 29 November (The Castle of Cagliostro) 
 Height: 178 cm 
 Weight: 70 kg 
  
 He is a smooth gunman who is most seen accompanying Lupin in his endeavors and heists. Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman. 
  
 He can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a PTRS anti-tank rifle. Daisuke is also a skilled driver and pilot. 
  
 In the original manga series, Jigen is not always at Lupin's side but lurking in the background until needed. The anime series, however, shows Jigen as extremely loyal to Lupin and willing to partner up anytime for a given heist. 
  
 Jigen is noted for his quick temper; enemy and friend alike have been victim to his need to repay violence for insult. Both Lupin and Goemon have been on the receiving end of his blows in his response to their frank or comical criticism. 
  
 Despite Jigen's gruff facade, he has an ironic sense of humor and genuinely enjoys participating in each caper with his partners. He is, by far, the more pragmatic of the group, with a cynical streak founded in failed romances (his luck with women runs from bad to worse, with love interests often betraying him or dying). He is always distrustful of Fujiko Mine and becomes irritated when Lupin goes along with one of her plans. Among Lupin's group, Jigen is the least apprehensive at taking human life. While he considers killing women and children taboo, he is willing to put down any age or gender who offers a life threat, such as Linda in Part 2 Episode 26. 
  
 Where Lupin and Goemon Ishikawa XIII both have unique sartorial tastes, Jigen is pure basics. His typical wardrobe is a dark grey, dark green or black business suit, along with a white or light blue colored dress shirt, a black tie, and his ever-present dark grey or black broad-brimmed fedora; the hat ranks as his most prized possession outside of his weaponry. During the third anime series, Jigen's outfit is more light colored and his hatband has a cross-hatched or grid pattern design (similar to the original manga interpretation of the character); however the black look is most applied for OVA productions and TV specials. Jigen's thick hair is typically collar-length and unevenly cut. His chin curtain beard varies from an inch to three inches long and is also unruly. A few episodes of the anime use an occasional gimmick where the character has his hat pulled forward so that only the lower half of his face is visible or, if he's without his hat, his hair will be covering his upper face and eyes. However such episodes are rare; and Jigen's face is plainly shown with or without his hat in most animated depictions. 
  
 Jigen is the ""big brother"" of the group, and often serves as the voice of reason to Lupin's impulsiveness, as he must because of his friendship with Lupin as well as out of sheer professionalism. However, he has long since resigned himself to having to go along with the craziest of schemes. Jigen, like the rest of the Lupin gang, is adept with disguises and can pilot virtually any motorized vehicle, including planes and tanks. He has even controlled a NASA Space Shuttle. He is also a tough hand-to-hand opponent, capable of knocking out an attacker with one blow. 
  
 While his racial origins may be in question, Jigen was at one time a famed bodyguard and assassin for many American criminal mobs. Of several stories regarding his past, the most popular has him an American mobster who moved to Japan on the lam; there he adopted a Japanese identity and name (""Jigen"" is the conventional Japanese word for ""dimension"", not a name). According to Lupin, Jigen's hobbies are limited due to his stay-at-home preference. When he does go out, he usually attends target practice, visits a favorite bar, plays poker, enjoys a boxing match or eats at a chop house-style restaurant. He also has a weakness for Spaghetti Westerns, lounging, classical music (except in Episodes 79 and 89 of Part 2), and hearty American food. 
  
 Jigen's most obvious pastime is smoking; there is hardly a time when he not seen with a cigarette, usually one bent in a number of directions. His preferred brands have been Pall Mall Filter Longs or Marlboro Red. He is also seen occasionally smoking a briar pipe. As well, Jigen enjoys drinking scotch, bourbon, vodka, beer and occasionally fine wines; he has a ""heavyweight's"" resistance to intoxication. 
  
 The Tokyo Pop releases of the original Lupin manga note in their preface that Jigen's appearance and temperament are based on the actor James Coburn, especially Coburn's role, Britt, in The Magnificent Seven. This has been confirmed by Monkey Punch during a 2003 Dallas, Texas anime convention interview. In a television documentary celebrating the manga's history, Monkey Punch stated he based the Jigen/Lupin relationship on Alain Delon and Charles Bronson's teaming in the 1968 film Adieu l'ami.

 Birthday: October 18 
  
 Kodaka's younger sister; she is a student in middle school, but nonetheless joins the club. She is very close to her brother, who she calls ""An-Chan"", and behaves in a jealous and clingy way whenever she feels that he is not giving her the attention she deserves, to the point where it is obvious that she has a brother complex. She sees Maria as a rival for Kodaka's brotherly affections, so she often gets into fights with her. 
  
 She has a penchant for darkness, vampires and the macabre ever since she started watching an anime called Full Metal Necromancer. As a result she often speaks in an affected fashion, and claims to be known as ""Reisys VI Felicity Sumeragi"", an ancient vampire who has lived for ten thousand years, but this façade quickly breaks down when she gets emotionally worked up and she speaks in a strong Kyūshū accent. Indeed, her behavior does not for the most part differ from that of a regular girl (procrastinating with her homework, staying inside when it is hot, etc.) which Kodaka points out, causing her to be embarrassed and slightly lose character.

1226,Canti(カンチ),FLCLFLCL Progressive,1374,https://myanimelist.net/character/633/Canti,"Canti is a medical robot with what looks like a television set for a head. He was manufactured by Medical Mechanica, but taken over by Atomsk as a way to escape MM. After having his head broken by Haruko he is recruited by her as an assistant, however he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family. It is later revealed that Atomsk can manifest through him, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk's symbol appears on Canti's screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for ""adult"" (大人). This symbol also appears on him when Naota ""swings the bat"" in Full Swing. When Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax, a similar symbol appears, but he uses the kanji for ""child"" (小人). 
  
 The emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason- shame. He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him. 
  
 Canti also dons a halo and fake wings (which Haruko was wearing in early episode two). Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him Lord Canti after ""The God of Black Flames"" in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series. Apparently, he can also eat curry with his ""mouth,"" but it is never really explained how.

 Birthday: February 5 
 Blood type: B 
 Genetic type: Coordinator 
 Height: 158 cm, 162 cm (GSmovie) 
  
 Lacus Clyne is a pop idol among the PLANTs, owing to both the influence of her father Siegel Clyne, Supreme Council chairmen of PLANT, and her beautiful singing voice (which many suspect may have developed due to her being a Coordinator). Near the beginning of the series she was engaged to Athrun Zala through an arranged marriage. Though (according to the drama CD) the two were in love when they first met, their feelings diminished as time went on and the engagement became more political then ever before. 
  
 The pink-haired princess enters the series when she is traveling in a civilian vessel for a memorial ceremony on Junius Seven. The ship is mistaken for a ZAFT military aircraft, and is attacked by the Earth Alliance. Lacus is escorted to a lifepod, and escapes safely. Shortly thereafter, Lacus' escape pod is discovered by Kira in the Strike. He brings the pod back to the Archangel. 
  
 The doors to the life pod open and out hops a small, pink, robotic ball. Following after it is Lacus Clyne herself in a bit of dismay that she was saved by Earth forces. Despite being enemies, the girl is cheery and kind to everyone on the ship as they keep her hostage. ZAFT forces discover the Archangel, and a battle breaks out. Before the Earth Alliance can suffer more loss, Natarle Badgiruel opens a channel to the enemy. It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel. 
  
 Kira is distraught and, due to Flay's abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus' Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira's Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun. 
  
 Even before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more.","16, 18 (GSD), 20 (GSFreedom)",,,"158 cm, 162 cm (GSmovie)",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/122415.jpg

Unlike all the citizens of the village, she can leave any time she wants and go wherever she pleases. 
  
 Although being beloved by the Narehate of the village, she is often irritated or angry according to Majikajya, and she seems to greatly dislike being observed. The Narehate in Ilblu freak her out a bit, especially the ones with lots of eyes. 
  
 She speaks in a simplistic and primitive manner, referring to herself in third person, and communicating only with short sentences that are sometimes hard to understand.

 Marika transfers to Raku's class and is introduced as his fiancée; she bears a key that she thinks will unlock Raku's pendant, and is the most vocal about expressing her love to Raku. She is the daughter of the police chief, and has been in love with Raku for the past ten years. She does not get along with Chitoge; she states she hates girls with long hair despite the fact that she also has long hair. She has a frail constitution; ten years prior, she was frequently visited by a young Raku, who brought her gifts and sparked a friendship with her. She used to speak in a rather vulgar manner but has attempted to correct her language after Raku had told her that he likes girly girls with long hair. However, when flustered, she reverts to her old speaking habits.

Thors is largely considered the greatest fighter to appear in the series, having defeated the likes of Askeladd and Thorkell in single combat.

 Eri is shown to be a perfect role model to the students in Otonokizaka High School. With her as the student council president, she is often portrayed as a cold and strict character due to her responsibilities, and being against the idea of Kousaka Honoka and her friends forming an idol group to get more attention from the public. 
  
 Eri is highly respected and well-known among the students, especially among her juniors. Unlike Nozomi, she appears rather stoic and skeptical in the early episodes, but it is shown that Eri is actually very kind and caring towards people that are close to her, like her little sister. On top of that, she is also very mature and level-headed and acts as a strategist in promoting their group.

 Ohana Matsumae is the main character of the story. She is an energetic and mostly optimistic 16-year-old high school girl. She was born in Tokyo, but is sent to live at her grandmother's inn, Kissuisou, when her mother elopes with her boyfriend to avoid debt. At her grandmother's request, she works at the inn as compensation for her residency. Before she leaves, her best friend, Kouichi Tanemura, confesses to her. However, he runs off before she can answer him. Ohana now feels awkward whenever she thinks about him. 
  
 She has many ideals and a strong sense of justice which often clash with people working at the inn; including her grandmother. Her desire to help others usually backfires or goes unappreciated. As a result of her mother's poor parenting, she became independent at a young age and grew up with the mentality of relying on herself only. However, since working at Kissuisou, she has realized how tough it is to go through life alone and begins to rely on others. She goes to the same high school as Minko, Nako, and Yuina.",16,,,147 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/132503.jpg

 A snake familiar at the Yonomori shrine. Nanami saved his life from her cruel classmates by releasing him out a window, he fell in love with her, so he left an engagement mark on her wrist. After a day, he arrives at her school and whisks her away to the shrine, which she is unable to escape from. 
  
 Unlike other snakes, he was apparently raised in a greenhouse and has little knowledge of how most snakes behave. Mizuki is also very lonely because his god has vanished; she once existed when people visited the shrine and believed in her, but now no one lives in the valley and she has dwindled away to nothing. However, he still believes that she exists and will return. As a result, he wants Nanami to live with him forever at his shrine, but when she refuses he tries to rape her and is interrupted by Tomoe. 
  
 It is revealed that the shrine is an illusion meant to hide his god's favorite plum tree, which Mizuki treasured. Nanami promised to come look at the blossoms with him whenever he felt lonely. Like Kurama he seems to still be harboring a crush on Nanami, and even comes to cook for her when she's ill.",,,,"175 cm (5'9"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/194005.jpg

 Nicknamed the ""Ghost Princess"", Perona is a girl dressed in Gothic Lolita style and a commander in the army of Gecko Moria on his island-ship of Thriller Bark. She is also the commander of Perona Wonder Garden, where an army of animal zombies live and protect her. She looted the Thousand Sunny with some zombies and later took on guard duty while Absalom was away attempting to marry Nami. She cannot stand anything that she feels is not cute, such as insects. 
  
 Perona has eaten the Horo Horo no mi (Ghost Ghost fruit) which allows her to create several ghostly apparitions. The ghosts can pass through someone to cause them to go into a sort of induced depression. 
  
 Trivia 
  
 Like many other characters in One Piece, Perona has a unique laugh (horohorohoro, which contains the word horo, meaning ghost. It is also the name of her devil fruit). 
  
 Perona's dream is to have her own country made up of cute zombie animals with her as their leader. 
  
 Perona had no knowledge of Brook nor about the incident that occurred five years ago when he first appeared because she slept through the entire incident, scolding Kumashi when he tried to alert her. 
  
 Many members of Thriller Bark seem to be based on old Horror movie character types; Perona is based off of ghosts.

 A dwarf warrior who joins the party so he can fulfil his dream of cooking the red dragon Laios and his party have set out to kill.

He makes sure the party is well fed and has a balanced diet. 
  
  
 He despises all forms of magic, believing its overuse can lead to one's downfall. He is initially quite stubborn about not using it at all, but eventually accepts essential spells to traverse the dungeon. He becomes unnerved at the presence of resurrection magic, as he says it is unnatural for people to come back from the dead. In other words, he treats magic with a great deal of gravity and caution.",112 (Senshi would be roughly 44-45 years old in terms of modern humans.),,,"140cm  4'7""",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/512505.jpg

 Natsume is a extremely intelligent, to the point of being considered a genius, and despite this, ditches class frequently. Hated and feared by a lot of students at the academy because of his dangerous Alice and cold attitude. Due to the isolation he feels from most of his classmates and hatred many student feel about him he is often bullied even though he comes to ignore it, although the class he is a part of holds him in very high regard and often follows his orders. 
  
 He is thoroughly unhappy with the school and is always suspicious of the intentions of adults because he believes that they use their power over the younger students to hurt and abuse. He is involved in top-secret missions for the Academy which are shady and haven't quite been explained in the story yet, although he often returns injured. 
  
 He is paired up as Mikan's partner in class by the their mostly-absent class teacher, Narumi. Although at first he rebels strongly against this duty, he later accepts it and begins to enjoy Mikan's company, along with the company of his classmates and finds himself getting friendlier as the series progresses, although he never quite loses his dangerous edge and temper. 
  
 He possesses the fire Alice. It is revealed early on that since Natsume has such a powerful Alice, it causes a lot of stress on his body to use and shortens his lifespan immensely. He had been showing the symptoms of a life shortening Alice for a year before the start of the series and had been progressing quickly due to the constant use of his abilities for missions for the Academy.

 Birthdate:  September 21 
 Occupation: High school student 
 Affiliation: Tousei Academy (Student); Chocolate Rabbit Guild (Member) 
  
 Akito Yamada is a high school student in his graduating year at the elite Tousei Academy. He is also a professional gamer. He is well-known in the gaming community for his expertise. He is attractive, but struggles to communicate with people (mainly women). He is initially antagonistic to Akane, whom he met during an offline event. 
  
 Yamada is a tall and lean. Most people perceive him as extraordinarily attractive, whether women or men, which causes him to respond most of the time awkwardly because he is an introvert. As a student at Tousei Academy, he wore the standard high school uniform throughout the first half of the series. Because his hair is longer, he would split it nicely to the left side. His hair reaches at least to his neck. His fringes are also nasal bridge length; if he doesn't separate them, they can cover his eyes. 
  
 He was dressed casually in a simple light-colored shirt, pants, and shoes during his first encounter with Akane at the Forest of Savior Game Event. Regardless of how modest his clothing is, Akane's initial impression of him is that he is attractive.

She is very innocent and dedicated. It is also noted that she is a beautiful singer. Despite her role as the titular character, she is a bit of an enigma within the series, as her origins have yet to be explained. She seeks to heal the heartaches of others, resulting in the filling up of a mysterious bottle called a ""flask"" with the suffering of those people's hearts so that someday she will be able to go to a certain place that she really wants to go. It has been implied that she came from another dimension. She seems to have no memories of her past. 
  
 Her only restriction appears to be that she cannot fall in love with anyone she heals the heart of. Curiously she also seems to not be allowed to take off her hat in public either, though this has yet to be addressed further. Kobato has a very cheerful and enthusiastic outlook in life and her wanting to aid others in need is very heartfelt and sincere. However, she can also be clumsy, rather clueless, and rash with her actions, and often trips over her own feet, much to Ioryogi's annoyance.

Link is usually depicted wearing a green tunic with a green floppy hat.  Throughout the many games released, there have been many Link's throughout the history of Hyrule that rose up to the challenge of saving the world from evil, mainly from the wrath of Ganondorf, the King of Thieves.  However, in the stories of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, it is the same Link who we see. In addition to the hero of time, the Link in Wind Waker is the same one as featured in Phantom hourglass. 
  
 Link is depicted as courageous, bold and although he is never seen to speak in the game, he shows no shyness in the manga as he is seen chatting quite a lot.  From his speech, we can see that Link is also a curious person who once he has a goal in mind, will set out and achieve it at all costs. 
  
 Our Hyrule savior, so far, has been the only one to wield the Master Sword, the evil-banishing sword. His swordsmanship is unparalleled throughout the land of Hyrule and he (usually) wields his weapons in his left hand.

 Temari is the oldest child of the Fourth Kazekage, making her the older sister of Gaara and Kankuro. Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins.  For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/292452.jpg

She is fairly popular among young males, apparently more people (primarily boys) began coming when she began working in the family's cafe, such that Keima's mother once had her dress as a maid to attract more customers on the ground that no-one could resist her when she's wearing it (from the reactions around her while she's wearing it and after she takes it off it can be inferred to be true). Her feather cloth (the floating scarf she is always seen with) can change the appearance of an object, create disguises to aid the mission or it can hide people in plain sight. She is left-handed and is rarely seen without her broom, which she had for 298 years, as it was from her original role as a cleaner for hell. She reveals that she has an older sister that was very famous and was known as the ""Demon of Demons"". Ironically, despite being a demon, she is shown to have an incredible fear of ghosts and the dark. 
  
 To stay close to Keima, she tells Mari, Keima's mother, that she is an illegitimate child of Keima's father (nearly getting his parents divorced), and ends up living in the Katsuragi household as well as attending the same class in school.",Over 300,,,159cm (with bun),,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/122016.jpg

 Height: 5' 5"" 
 Weight: 108 lbs 
 Birth year: 733 Age 
 Hobby: Inventing 
 Favorite food: Strawberries 
 Favorite vehicle: All Types of Vehicles 
  
 Bulma is originally a secondary main character, but her role is quickly downplayed as the series continues, even though she does remain an important support character for most of the series. Bulma is a direct parody of the character Xuanzang from the Chinese novel Journey to the West. Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name ""Buruma"" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word ""bloomers,"" which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century. 
  
 Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.",,,,"5' 5""",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/280893.jpg

 A middle school boy who has chuunibyou tendencies. He loves spending time reading books in the library, where he and Anna first met. Initially, Kyotaro had delusions of killing Anna and making her corpse his alone, but they were replaced by romantic affection as he spends more time around her. He can be quite perceptive in social situations but often fails to pick up on other social problems due to his lack of communication skills and low self-esteem. Aside from his macabre interests, he's also a fan of manga and anime such as Baki, Beastars and Re:Zero. In the latter case he keeps the character Rem as the profile image for his Line account. Prior to middle school, he won a number of first-place awards for essays, a poster drawing, an independent research project, etc.

 Hanyuu is the mysterious ""transfer student"" in Matsuribayashi-hen. She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them, with the exception of Takano, who calls her a ""monster""). 
  
 In fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others, posing as a distant relative of Rika's and given the name ""Hanyuu Furude."" Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form. 
  
 She is very meek and often makes the noise ""Au au, au au…"" when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She also tends to end her sentences with nano desu (なのです?, lit. ""it is so""). 
  
 She dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu's and Rika's senses are linked together). She mentions that she is a ""being above humans"" after being sacrificed to atone for the sin of humans, while both Rika and Takano describe her as a kind of deity. 
  
 Rika refers to her as ""Oyashiro"" when talking with others (evident from Shion's chat with Rika in Meakashi-hen) but does not personally think of her as Oyashiro; instead, she sees her as a close friend. 
  
 In Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, Hanyuu tells Rika that she was sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people of the village, and Hanyuu asked Ōka Furude (Hanyuu's own daughter and Rika's ancestor) to kill her and then make the village a better place.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/451009.jpg

Due to his reptile-like features, he is sometimes referred to as ""Alligator"" or ""Gator"" and even ""Crocodile"". Rak refers to his friends and people he meets as ""turtles"" of different colours and features (ex: black turtle, blue turtle, crazy turtle); the term by which he also earnestly addresses his ""prey"". 
  
 Rak is able to change his size so that he is smaller and convenient to walk around because he is a Compression Lisensor which gives him the ability to shrink his size at will so he can move around the Tower more easily.

She is physically abusive towards, and often argues with, Sena and manipulative towards Maria, who she cons into giving up an empty room for the use of the Neighbor's Club, and Yukimura, who she fools into working for the club as a crossdressing cosplay maid. The only person she can't insult is Rika, as Rika takes whatever insult she gives her and deflects it back with a dirty joke that leaves her tired—to the point where she just does what Rika says (like crossdress for example) rather than argue.",,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/37513/Yozora_Mikazuki: 'src'

 Komui's younger sister, and assistant Head Officer. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young. Because she is an Accommodator, the Black Order took her away from her only remaining family member (Komui) to Headquarters against her will. For three years she was never allowed to leave the place, which felt like a prison to her. Because she attempted suicide, she had to be restrained and tied to her bed. However, once Komui joined the Black Order, Lenalee became more at ease in the Black Order. She once told Allen that her ""world"" consists of her friends and family; if something terrible ever happened to them, she would be devastated. 
  
 She is an Exorcist whose anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of boots, ""Dark Boots."" That, when invoked increases one's speed and strength greatly in the legs. 
  
 Aside from being able to have great speed, she can also fly with her boots. Techiniques shown so far:

1320,Sakura(サクラ),Tsubasa ChronicleTsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no HimegimiTsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season,1237,https://myanimelist.net/character/127/Sakura,"Birthday: April 1 
 Age: 14 
  
 At the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend. 
  
 When she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die. 
  
 Fei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Yūko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all. 
  
 In order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Yūko the thing most important to her and she pays Yūko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking ""Who are you?"" 
  
 At times, such as in Ōuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more. 
  
 Sakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Yūko call her ""a favored daughter of the gods"". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Yūko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to ""hear"" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over. 
  
 Sakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she's lost most of her memories, she'll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it's washing dishes or saving their lives.",14,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/127/Sakura: 'src'

 Height: 173 cm 
 Weight: 60 kg 
 Family: father (deceased), mother (deceased) 
 Allies: Markkio, Al-Thamen, Gyokuen Ren (former), Hakuei Ren, Kouen Ren, Kouha Ren, Koumei Ren, Kougyoku Ren, Hakuryuu Ren 
 Enemies: Sinbad, Ja'far, Masrur, Aladdin, Alibaba Saluja, Ugo 
 Djinn: Cassim (former) 
 Occupation: Magi, Magician and Oracle 
 Affiliation: Kou Empire and Al-Thamen 
  
 Judar is one of the four Magi in the current era and a Magician specialized in Ice Magic. He is the Oracle of Al-Thamen and the Kou Empire. 
  
 Judar is very powerful, cruel, arrogant and somewhat childish. Usually he doesn't listen to anyone's advice or orders, and does things his own way. He is usually disrespectful, even to his fellow Magi. He seems to be careless about what others think, goading Sinbad into feeling pity for him and then laughing at him. He is a good actor, and goes to great lengths to mock others. 
  
 However, he also seems to hold deep grudges as he couldn't forgive Al-Thamen or Gyokuen Ren for using his life for their own ends and asked why they couldn't have used Scheherazade or Yunan and why it had to be him. 
  
 Judar was chosen by the Rukh and was born in a poor village in the far east plain. Right after Judar was born, his parents, along with everyone else in his village, were immediately killed by Al-Thamen. Judar was taken by the organization, and was taken advantage of before he was able to understand anything. He was taught magic there. He has been in this situation since infancy. Shortly after the founding of the Kou Empire, he was taken there by Al-Thamen and became the empire's Oracle and High Priest. 
  
 Judar was trained in Magic ever since infancy by the members of Al-Thamen. Since he specializes in Ice Magic he is a ""Blue Magician"", as ice is a sub-type of Water Magic. Being a Magi, he has an almost limitless supply of Magoi. Nevertheless, without Magic Judal it becomes completely useless, for its physical capacity is very low, having to depend on someone else. 
  
 He is named after the eponymous hero of The Tale of Judar and His Brethren from One Thousand and One Nights.

During the Meiji era, he lived as a police officer under the name of Gorou Fujita. In the Rurouni Kenshin series, he plays the role of Kenshin's old rival and enemy from the Bakumatsu. He has no compassion or mercy for his enemies and he lives by the Shinsengumi code ""Aku Soku Zan (悪即斬),"" literally ""Slay Evil Immediately,"" but more poetically rendered as ""Swift Death To Evil."" His signature technique is the Gatotsu, a left-handed thrust and a variation of the Hirazuki technique developed by Toshizou Hijikata, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Although the Gatotsu is a fictional technique only found within the Rurouni Kenshin series, the Hirazuki is a real technique that was used by many of the Shinsengumi members.

 In most situations, Sarada is kind-hearted and brave, polite to others and considerate of her friends and family, wishing well for them and standing up for them when they need her. She doesn't mind saying what she's thinking, whether it's a question she wants the answer to, an opinion she holds firmly, or a frustration she can't let go of. Like Sakura, Sarada is quite well-read: she feels comfortable arguing the differences between a panda and a normal bear, and she is apparently the only participant in the Chūnin Exams to have heard of the book series called Shinobi Strategist Detective Story, much less read all four volumes. 
  
 Sarada is appreciative of Naruto for his help in mending her relationship with her parents, finding him to be kind and warm. She is quite interested in his Will of Fire, wherein he tries to form bonds with everyone (particularly villagers of Konoha) that he can. Because of Naruto, Sarada decides to make it her dream to become Hokage, preferring the kind of life Naruto has to the life of her father. She is so fond of Naruto that in a conversation with Kawaki, she admits she has wondered on many occasions what her life would be like if she were Naruto's daughter, envying Boruto for the wonderful father he has and recriminating him for not appreciating and reproaching his father for his difficult work as a Hokage. In the anime, she even shows great appreciation for the Hokage Rock and fantasizes about having her own likeness carved into it. However, Sarada shares a complicated relationship with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, although she is also interested in him due to their similar relationships with their respective fathers. The two ninjas are often at odds with one another, with the young Uchiha valuing the Hokage post while Boruto initially showing utter disdain for it, and they usually argue and fight with each other for almost anything. Despite this, they are very close, deeply caring for one another's well-being and actually supporting their dreams greatly.","Gaiden: 11, Boruto Movie: 12",March 31,,"Blank Period: 125 cm, Boruto Movie: 147 cm",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/292448.jpg

1332,Asirpa(アシㇼパ),Golden KamuyGolden Douga GekijouGolden Kamuy 2nd Season,1218,https://myanimelist.net/character/138552/Asirpa,"Asirpa is a young Ainu huntress and the deuteragonist of the Golden Kamuy series. After Asirpa saves Sugimoto's life and learns the story of hidden gold, the two start their search for the treasure. 
  
 She is an independent and capable young girl. She initially appears cold and withdrawn, but that quickly changes once she warms up to the other and exposes a more jovial and childish side. 
  
 When with her friends and family, Asirpa is a playful and cheerful girl. She enjoys cooking and is enthusiastic about hunting. She occasionally likes to tease others, especially Sugimoto and Shiraishi. 
  
 As a hunter, Asirpa is aware of the cruelty of nature. She knows that in the wilderness weakness leads to death and thus is very pragmatic about survival. She acts mature and serious when hunting her prey or discussing the plans of finding the gold. However, Asirpa has strict principles and beliefs, as she refuses to murder people even if her life is at stake. 
  
 She considers herself a modern Ainu woman who occasionally dismisses Ainu customs, such as tattooing her mouth or believing in fortune-telling. However, more than anything, Asirpa wants to protect the Ainu and preserve her people's independence. After her journey to Karafuto and the many revelations that followed, she has decided to find the gold to assure that the Ainu and their culture will never be erased or forgotten.

 The student council president and a second-year student. She is serious, diligent, and talented in most subjects. However, she is almost always thinking of perverted things, even suggesting that one of her main reasons to be interested in Tsuda is curiosity about information not covered in health classes. She is also a very popular girl with a lot of female fans in school, and has a complex about her chest, which is exacerbated by the fact that Aria happens to be more well-endowed than she is. She later develops some feelings for Tsuda.

She is walking through the Hole, unable to summon a door back to the Magic Users' world due to the barrier between worlds currently in effect. She runs in to Caiman and Nikaido, who advance on her in their common fashion. Caiman cuts off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his ""question"", a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped down jaws, in to the door. This sudden and jerky movement causes trauma to her face and head, but they both get to safety. 
  
 After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares—and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some (supposedly temporary,) brain damage as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita in the manga panels, possibly leading to believe that they are ""partners"" now. 
  
 Her smoke is not seen directly, but records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. 
  
 She is often the butt of slapstick humor throughout the story, often being maimed in comedic fashion.

1339,Diavolo(ディアボロ),JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 5: Ougon no KazeJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 5: Ougon no Kaze Recaps,1207,https://myanimelist.net/character/27155/Diavolo,"Diavolo, the main villain of Part 5, was born in a female prison. His birth is a mystery because his mother claimed that he was conceived two years before her sentence and all the guards were female. Diavolo was raised by a priest in his mother's hometown of Sardinia because she can't raise him while in prison. When he turned 19, when the priest was constructing an apartment for Diavolo, he found his mother buried alive under a stone tablet. Around the same time, a fire broke out and the priest and Diavolo were among the seven who died in the fire. However, in reality Diavolo survived and joined Passione soon after. During that time, Diavolo recovered the bow and six Arrows in Egypt and quickly ran off with them. He then sold five of the Arrows to Enya Geil and kept the remaining one for himself (that same arrow was attached to Polpo's Black Sabbath). Between Stardust Crusaders and Golden Wind, he sets out to kill all his blood relatives, and those who discover his identity, to ensure his name is erased from existence and he took the pseudonym Soliddo Nazo during his years in Passione. 
  
 Diavolo means ""devil"" in Italian, fitting considering his personality and role as the main antagonist of Part 5. 
  
  Stand 
 King Crimson—A light red humanoid whose face appears to have a smaller copy of itself in its forehead, perhaps to mirror Diavolo's psyche. King Crimson has the power to predict up to ten seconds into the future, and ""erase time,"" effectively causing a time skip, where everything except itself and Diavolo is suddenly changed to be in the state they would have been a short time later (usually 3–10 seconds later). Time still flows normally for Diavolo, who can interact (or not interact, he can choose which objects to interact with) with the time-skipped objects for the amount of time that would have normally intervened (to Diavolo this appears in the form of the would-have-been intervening objects' states being superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to Nude Descending a Staircase). The nature of the time skip is such that, for example, he predicts a bullet coming at him, and erases the time that it would have hit him in. To the viewer a bullet that would have hit Diavolo will suddenly be shifted to be on his other side as where it would be seconds later.

 Ayato Kirishima is Touka Kirishima's younger brother, and goes by the alias Black Rabbit. He grew up with his sister in the 20th ward but at some point in time, he left the district. According to Kazuichi Banjou, Ayato subsequently began to wander all the wards of Tokyo, bringing sheer wreckage and chaos upon them, until his unique powers and abilities caught Tatara’s eye. Ayato was therefore pulled into joining Aogiri Tree, where he is currently an Executive. 
  
 Ayato is an arrogant, brash teenager, with a similar hot-blooded attitude resembling his sister's, while he normally displays either a scowl or menacing smirk on his face. Other than his physicalities, he shares many similarities with Touka, such as his tendency to use language that is often uncouth or inappropriate. He has a habit for kicking people over the simplest mistakes; such as when Kaneki failed to address him with the desired honorific, or when Banjou didn’t return his missed calls. However, he seems to be more harsh compared to his sister, but admits himself to be surprisingly ""softer"" than his Aogiri superiors. He is a firm believer in the notion that ‘the weak perish and the strong survive,’ which was triggered by the death of his mother and father. Ayato bears deep grudges against his father, Arata, for abandoning him and Touka when they were young. Ayato has even stated that the whole reason for hating Kaneki was his resemblance to Arata. It was also pointed out by Kaneki that Ayato cares deeply for Touka subconsciously, as shown when he beat her down first rather than allowing her to suffer a slow, torturous death from Yamori. Later on, he also took her alias, ""Rabbit"" so that the CCG would hunt him instead of Touka. Ayato also seems to have a soft spot for rabbits.

 Amuro was born on Earth and raised in the space colonies of Side 7. Amuro's father is an Earth Federation technician who helps the Federation build new weapon designs. Since he has seen many of his fathers work, he's a very skilled technician himself. As soon as Zeon attacked the colony he was living in, he came across the RX-78-2 Gundam and used it to stop them. 
  
 After countless battles Amuro learned of his Newtype abilities, and was considered one of the strongest mobile suit pilots. Since the Gundam was white he was considered as the White Ghost by many of his enemies. 
  
 After the One Year War, Amuro was placed under house arrest by the Titan forces, believing that he would join the AEUG. Eventually that is what Amuro did and was able to escape Titan hands with some help from his friend Fraw Bow. He teams up with Kamille and teaches him the ways of a Newtype, but he can't help but feel jealous that he's no longer considered the famous Gundam pilot. 
  
 After the war between the Titans and the AEUG, Amuro returns to the E.F.S.F. to fight against the Neo Zeon threat. He becomes part of the Londo Bell forces with Bright Noa. 
  
 Soon Amuro became one of the E.F.S.F. best pilots and was given higher honor among all soldiers of the E.F.S.F.

While in Korea he lives his life as a shut-in for an entire year being unable to find an actual job. After saving an old man from being killed by loan sharks, he was scouted and invited to join ""Q"" a local gang(gondal) to work under Tae-soo as one of his underlings. 
  
 After fighting against Tae-soo, he was offered the position of boss instead. He initially declined since he wanted to join the police force alongside Yumin but Tae-soo eventually manipulates him into taking the position. 
  
 His strength and sense of justice earns him the loyalty of his gang and the local community. As the leader of the Sun-Ken Rock Gang, he often hides his true identity from others (ex.: he tells Yumin he works at a video game company as a cover). Ken's parents were killed during a Yakuza war when he was 13. The character design of Ken is heavily influenced from Vash of Trigun Manga.

 In contrast to his appearance, he is rather quiet and gentle and has his difficulties realizing that he is Karasuno's ace as he initially doesn't feel that way. He shows to be weak-willed at the beginning when he leaves the team before the first years come, feeling that he let down his entire team when they lost against Date Tech High even though they counted on him.  After coming back to Karasuno, he realizes that his will to play volleyball is much stronger than he thought and with the help of his teammates, he acknowledges his position as Karasuno's ace (even though he is still mocked sometimes by Daichi for not having any ""ace-like presence"") and gains self-confidence. 
  
 Asahi is said to have a ""Heart of Glass"", taking everything that is said about him to heart and reacting depressed because of it at times. While he still feels insecure about a lot of things and seems to be quite a scaredy-cat, he clearly states that he has no intention of letting anyone take his ace position away from him in later chapters, showing his development from the beginning.

 Birthday: November 14th 
 Favourite Food: Jelly 
 Least Favorite Food: Spicy Food 
  
 Utena is a shy and introverted girl who longingly admires magical girls, collects their memorabilia, and talks about them passionately. At some point, her obsession had reached the point where she wished to fight alongside Tres Magia, but that led to her being tricked into joining Enormeeta by Venalita. 
  
 Although reluctant to accept it at first, her true nature is sadistic, and she tends to lack self-restraint when facing magical girls. When she first recognized she wanted to humiliate magical girls, she felt conflicted by her past feelings of admiration. However, after a near defeat at the hands of Magia Sulfur, she now more readily embraces her sadistic side. 
  
 She has a magical weapon that takes the form of a riding crop called Frusta Dominazione (Lash of Domination), with it she can strike inanimate objects, animals, and plants to create a Schiavo (Slave), a minion created by magic that can be directly controlled by her. 
  
 The word ""baiser"" in the name for her magical alter ego, ""Magia Baiser"", has French origins. When used as a noun, it translates to ""kiss"". When used as a verb, it is a vulgar slang term for sex.

1361,Hoozuki(鬼灯),Hoozuki no ReitetsuHoozuki no Reitetsu OVAHoozuki no Reitetsu 2nd Season,1188,https://myanimelist.net/character/79669/Hoozuki,"Hoozuki is the talented, sadistic deputy of the King of Hell, Enma. He tries to solve various problems in Hell. In his spare time, he takes care of the animals and raises Goldfish grass. 
  
 Hoozuki is a tall but slight oni (Japanese ogre) with black hair that parts in the middle and has a horn on his forehead. His ears are rather large and pointed, as are his fangs. Hoozuki's eyes are grey and slanted, with red markings at their sides. These red markings seem permanent as he retains them after washing and during his sleep. He wears a black yukata with red lining and obi with a Chinese lantern ( this represents both his name and symbol)embroidered on the back. He is rarely seen without his toothed metal club which is extraordinarily heavy, but Hoozuki's superhuman strength allows him to wield it easily. It is also noted by many women such as the Stone Princess and female minions think that he is rather good looking. Noted by Momotaro and King Enma to be similar in appearance to Hakutaku. He actually takes great care in his personal appearance. 
  
 He is very stoic and serious, rarely losing his cool under any circumstance (though he frequently blows his top whenever Hakutaku or Enma Daio are involved). It is also implied that he is very manipulative, shown in episode 13 where he admits to enjoying working for Enma as his right-hand man, only because this allows him to manipulate and control the Underworld from the shadows. He gets called a sadist often by various people, yet he himself denies it. ' 
  
 Hoozuki seems to enjoy resorting to violent means to resolving problems, seen when he confronts Momotaro and tells him ""This is Hell so let's settle this with violence"". Hoozuki sees violence as the fastest way to deal with whatever difficulties he faces and takes sadistic delight in doing so. He is also proficient in inflicting mental anguish verbally, traumatizing Beelzebub so much after their first meeting that the prime minister of European hell vomits blood the next time he encounters Hoozuki. Hoozuki's sharp intellect serves him beyond affairs of the state, enabling him to win any argument and cow potential enemies such as Satan and Momotaro's three animal companions. Those who fall prey to Hoozuki's sharp tongue typically sink into depression, vomit blood or develop a serious phobia of Hoozuki the next time they encounter him. 
  
 Hoozuki is portrayed as somewhat unforgiving in nature as well, grinding several of his goldfish plants into juice and feeding them to Enma as punishment for them trying to escape from his garden patch. 
  
 Hoozuki is highly skilled in a variety of arts inluding the brewing of herbal concoctions, rearing goldfish plants as well as combat. His management and organization skills are also impeccable, making him the most important man in Hell besides Enma. Hoozuki proves himself to be adept at killing two birds with one stone, using the mountain of left-over offerings of the dead to feed the ten kings of hell, or sending Momotaro to work in Heaven's peach orchard. The minions of Hell typically flock to him whenever they face problems and he proves more than capable of dealing with the variety of dilemmas presented to him with a combination of cunning and brute strength. 
  
 Despite his cool and sadistic exterior though, Hoozuki is extremely fond of animals. He expresses disgust, and even outright hatred for humans who abuse animals and treats Momotaro's three animal companions like his friends. In the first episode he is also seen discussing plans with Enma to visit the Outback so he can see Australia's great variety of interesting animals. Hoozuki also admits to visiting a great number of zoos all over the human world during his vacations there, hiding his ears and horns under a hat while telling curious tourists that he is training to be a ninja. 
  
 Hoozuki also treats women cordially, seen where he befriends Peach Maki and even helps her to punish the old lady who had been stealing from her ex-work place. When Hoozuki, Enma, Oko, Karauri and Nasubi are trapped in Cold Hell, Oko is also seen wearing Hoozuki's overcoat to help her endure Cold Hell's freezing climate. 
  
 Hoozuki seems to prefer women who are resistant to gross objects that typical women would normally shun, complimenting a female show caster on television for being able to study a gigantic grub without flinching. Furthermore, when Stone Princess asks Hoozuki whether he would marry her or her more beautiful sister, Blossom Princess, Hoozuki replies that he will marry the woman who agrees to drink his brain-tissue miso soup. Beauty seems to be of little consequence to Hoozuki compared to his ideal mate's ability to share his eccentric and often gruesome preferences. Despite his sadistic personality, Hoozuki is very popular with women who are attracted by his looks and reserved demeanour.The stripping hag constantly tries to flirt with him to no avail and many female oni in Shugou Hell are seen giggling while staring at him. 
  
 Hoozuki is a deep sleeper, but his wrath can be terrible once awakened prematurely. Once on vacation, Enma incessantly invited a sleeping Hoozuki to admire stag-beetles at the window and received a vicious kick that sent him flying as a result of bothering the oni in his sleep. When Shiro, Kakisuke and Rairo venture into Hoozuki's room to ask for a visit to Shangri-La, Shiro nearly dies of fright when Hoozuki suddenly awakens and grabs his tail. 
  
 A running gag in the anime series shows Hoozuki getting angry when he is told that he looks similar to Hakutaku.

 The snake of the zodiac, and big brother to Yuki, Ayame is vivacious, garrulous, and has a knack for making Yuki and Kyou angry. He runs a business that makes women's clothing, which men apparently wear as well, and he often wears women's clothing himself. He named his shop after himself and runs it with Mine, who is later revealed to be Ayame's girlfriend and the seamstress of the store. Ayame designs the dresses, erotic as some or all of them may be. Vain and somewhat self-conscious, he is really a thoughtful person underneath his ""selective"" skin. He has gorgeous gold eyes and silver hair in a startling contrast to Yuki's violet and grey. His fear, coincidentally, is a fear of being totally alone. Much to Yuki's chagrin and surprise, he was actually the student body president in high school. When Ayame was young, he did not care for Yuki at all until he realized that when he got older, he would be totally alone without Yuki, spurring his new obsession to gaining Yuki's love shown in the series. Yuki has slowly started to accept Ayame as a brother.

1364,"Prussia(プロイセン, ギルベルト・バイルシュミット, 俺様)","Hetalia Axis Powers Fan DiscHetalia Axis PowersHetalia Axis Powers Movie: Paint it, White",1182,https://myanimelist.net/character/18497/Prussia,"Nation's name: Kingdom of Prussia (Königreich Preußen) 
 Capital: Köningsberg 
 Language: German 
 Birthday: January 18 
 National flower: Cornflower 
  
 Human name: Gilbert Beilschmidt 
 Height: 177 cm (5'9"") 
 Age: 20 (appearance) 
  
 A now non-existent country that was dissolved by the Allies in 1947. He was born to fight, fight, fight, and avoided marriages at all costs. His hair is platinum blonde with deep violet-red eyes to match, but in early artwork, his hair was colored dark blonde and his eyes were blue. 
  
 In the past, he picked on Hungary, whom he thought to be male because of her burly personality and appearance as a child. Eventually, the two found out that Hungary was actually female, and since then, their relationship has been somewhat awkward, and because of their competitive childhood (and the fact that they still hold grudges against each other for all of the things that they did to torture each other in the past), they don't really get along. However, Hungary did mention once that she'd be very lonely if anything ever happened to Prussia. In response, Prussia often shows dismay and somberness whenever he spots Hungary and Austria spending time together. 
  
 Prussia's younger brother and drinking buddy is Germany, whom he affectionately calls ""West."" After he was dissolved, Prussia moved into Germany's house and has lived there ever since. You can usually find Germany cleaning and organizing their home, stumbling over and complaining about all of the ""weird"" décor and other things that Prussia buys. The two seem to butt heads every now and then, but overall, they get along pretty well and Prussia appears to be an affectionate (but terribly irresponsible) big bro. 
  
 It seems as though he also has a lot of love for Italy. He once took several snapshots of him (and one with Romano in it) when he went to Italy's house for dinner, proceeding to post them on his blog. Also, he affectionately calls Italy, ""Italy-chan."" 
  
 For several reasons, Prussia hates Russia. At one time, he was completely terrified by him, but currently, he's not as afraid. This was said to be because Germany is now a very strong and stable country that Russia won't be able to breach anytime soon, which, when reflecting upon this, was mentioned to make Prussia very proud of his little brother. 
  
 Although he was generally pretty close with his leaders, no other has ever come as close as Frederich II was with him, whom he calls ""Old Man Fritz."" Although he passed away a long time ago, Prussia hopes that Old Man Fritz is watching him from heaven and is proud of everything that he's done since his death. 
  
 As far as his personality goes, he's extremely loyal, and will do anything to become stronger. However, he's quite arrogant, thinking that he's better and more ""awesome"" than anyone else. Germany once said that Prussia has practically no common sense, but really, he has the diligence of a tough soldier; his bad manners kind of cover that up, though. Prussia's left-handed, and according to his profile on his blog, his blood type is most likely A. He's been shown to own a little yellow bird, which often sits on his head or shoulder. Prussia was not aware of this bird's existence until a ""fan"" of his blog ""sent him an email"" about it. The bird hasn't been officially named yet by Hidekaz Himaruya, but it's often called ""Gilbird"" among fans. 
  
 He refers to himself as ""Ore-sama"" ( ""Ore"" in Japanese is the male diminutive of ""I,"" but is considered more ""manly"" but improper when compared to its ""more-polite"" counterpart, ""boku,"" which also means ""I"" in the masculine tense. ""Sama"" is an honorific used when referring to someone of higher status than the speaker). Another (fanmade) nickname of his is ""Gilbo."" Although not canon, it is a popular moniker among fans. 
  
 His human surname was once rendered as ""Weillschmidt"" for some time among fans. However, since it does not exist as an actual German surname, ""Beilschmidt"" seems to be a more proper translation.

 Skilled, reliable, smart, and beautiful, Yakumo is one of the most admired girls in the school. Despite that fact, she has never had a boyfriend. This is due mostly to her mind-reading ability, as she can easily read the secret intentions of any boy who tries to approach her.

It turns out her role as Princess Tutu is to gather Myuuto's missing heart so he can gain back the many feelings of sadness and happiness.

 Sagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekihō Army (Sekihō-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong. 
  
 The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself. 
  
 Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname ""Zanza"" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush. 
  
 Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc. 
  
 At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.

Beelzebub's characteristic cry is ""Daabuu!"" and he is always naked with a pacifier in his mouth. 
  
 Baby Be'el is very easily impressed, especially by strong people since he himself is still weak and loses to other babies as well as to cats. On the other hand he is not the smartest one out there and tries to force his way through the most simple problems. It is also shown that he is afraid of insects. He often displays a fondness for things that might frighten ""normal"" babies, such as violence, exposed muscle tissue (on an anatomy model), heavy metal music, and demonic toys.

 A 17 year old sophomore high school student, Takashi is in the same class as Rei whom he has been friends with since childhood,He's loved her ever since she made a childhood promise to marry him when they were older. However it was his hesitance and ignorance about her feelings that caused tension in their friendship which led to her starting to date his friend Hisashi. He was one of the first people to notice that something was wrong in the school and quickly took action to escape with his friends. His relationship with Rei was shaken further when he was forced to kill her boyfriend after he was bitten and had turned into a zombie. Soon afterwards their relationship was amended. His resolve to protect Rei at all costs and everyone else in the group earned him their respect and admiration as a leader despite his own feelings of inadequacy. He often acts brash and will go out to risk his life to save or protect someone on a whim. Similar to Saeko, Takashi confessed that he's found an exhilaration in killing ""them"". 
  
 Though initially depicted as a poor student who often skips class, he's proven to be a very reliable person that all the characters can count on. Saya Takagi has once mentioned that he and Kohta are the most likely to snap if things keep going the way they are. Like the rest of the group, Takashi is determined to find his parents and to make sure that they're safe.

 The main heroine and number one ranked second year student until Kazuya's interference during a tournament at the start of the story causes her to be demoted to rank two. Having been abused by her half-brother throughout most of her childhood, she developed an intense haphephobia, a mental phobia that causes fear of being touched. She is feared by most students due to her ruthless actions against her opponents and anyone who touches her. After an incident at East Genetics, in which she attacked a Limiter who wanted to be her partner and other Pandoras, she was suspended for a year and nicknamed the ""Untouchable Queen"", transferring into West Genetics thereafter. Curiously, she does not go berserk when touched by Kazuya and after some time denying his company she accepts him as her Limiter. Despite her reputation and ruthlessness during battle, she has a quiet and reserved nature. 
  
 Her name is usually shortened to Satella or Stella. Formerly known as Satellizer Alongrutch, she was born from the head of the infamous el Bridget family who impregnated her mother Noelle Allouache. Her mother was very sickly and in order not to worsen their situation she was forced to endure the abuses of her half-brother, Louis, until her half-sister Violet found out and decided to move her away for her own safety. At her mother's deathbed, her mother apologized to her for the suffering she had endured and told her that she must never lose or give up and also to become stronger than anyone. Her memories become her driving force in life resulting in her severe determination and will. Despite her low synchronization rate with stigmas, she was implanted with six of Kazuha Aoi's stigmas before her enrollment into Genetics because of her family's influence.

 Fuutarou Uesugi is the main protagonist of the series. He is a serious and hardworking high school student, and a prodigy at the top of his grade. Due to financial reasons, he is tasked to tutor the Nakano Quintuplets. 
  
 According to Isanari, Fuutarou used to be similar to his father as a child, having a wild personality and being bad at studying. He currently lives a frugal lifestyle, preferring solitude. Someone comments that Fuutarou is always like this, trying not to associate himself with everything. Ichika comments that Fuutarou is direct and doesn't mince words. Yotsuba's first impression of Fuutarou is that he is a gloomy man and doesn't have many friends. His facial expression is always serious, sometimes he looks grumpy and annoyed, and he rarely blushes or gets flustered. Fuutarou thinks that being the Class Representative would only be hindering his studies. 
  
 Fuutarou is noted to have a big ego and high confidence. He can also be rude and direct, but he is actually able to contain his emotions. Despite that, Fuutarou could momentarily lose his composure when agitated and faced with unfavorable circumstances. He also does not like to get involved with other people's problems, as they find it troublesome. 
  
 Fuutarou has been shown to be very hardworking and has a lot of patience, as he is able to tutor several girls who have below average scores. It is personally stated and implied that Fuutarou currently has no interest in romantic relationships. He considers love as something silly. 
  
 Raiha describes Fuutarou as an ""overconfident"" guy and a ""study freak"". 
  
 Nino encourages Fuutarou about his future love life, despite labeling him a tactless guy. Ichika also said the same thing when she visited him in the hospital. 
  
 Fuutarou has a habit of covering his mouth with his left hand when he feels embarrassed

Conan & Heiji VS Kid!Meitantei Conan Movie 10: Tantei-tachi no Requiem,1159,https://myanimelist.net/character/1745/Heiji_Hattori,"Hattori Heiji is a high school detective from Osaka, titled Great Detective of the West. He came to Tokyo to test himself against Shinichi. Thanks to his detective skills, Heiji eventually figured out that Conan is the brains behind Mouri, and that Conan is in fact Shinichi. The two become good friends after that, working on cases together when the opportunity arises. Occasionally Heiji gets Conan into a tight spot by calling him Kudou in front of Ran, but thanks to his puns, everything always seems alright. 
  
 Heiji has a strong Kansai accent and he can't seem to speak standard Japanese because his accent is so strong. Heiji is the son of the Osaka district police commissioner (a position at the top of the hierarchy), but Heiji prefers to get by on his own merits. Heiji gets his slightly dark skin from his grandfather. His childhood friend, Toyama Kazuha, has a budding, but denied romance going with him. In Detective Conan's 7th movie, it's revealed that Kazuha is apparently Heiji's first love, but Kazuha didn't know about it.

 Famiglia: Vongola/Bovino

 Box weapon: Gyuudon (Vongola Lightning Bull a.k.a. Beef Bowl) 
  
 Lambo is a hitman assassin from Italy's Bovino family. He is also the self proclaimed rival of Reborn. 
  
 His main choice of weapons are hand grenades and horns, and his future dream is to rule the world. Lambo dresses in a cow suit complete with a tail and has a huge afro with horns on the sides of his head which gives him the appearance of a bison. He has pretty good resistance against lightning. 
  
 Although he claims to be the ""great Lambo-san,"" Lambo is a total crybaby. Because of that he occasionally uses the Ten Year Bazooka to switch places with his 10-year older alternative. But, it is seen that even 10 years older Lambo is still a complete crybaby and unable to beat Reborn. Though if he uses the 10-year bazooka again, he becomes very powerful.

 Weight: 97 lbs (44 kg) 
 Rank: Kame-sennin (Turtle Hermit) 
  
 The ""Turtle Immortal"" is an ancient and wise martial arts master and the first Earthling to wield the Kamehameha. Though he seems frail, he is a mighty warrior. Muten-Rôshi trained Grandpa Son Gohan, Ox King, Son Goku, Kuririn, and Yamcha. His home, Kame House, a shack on a small isolated island, serves as a gathering place for the Z Fighters and friends. He is a stock character, as he is both the archetypal wise old man and dirty old man, the latter being typical of shōnen anime. Sometimes he gets cranky, which further provides comic relief. He is bald, with a thick goatee and a thick mustache. Muten-Rôshi wears beach clothes or a martial arts suit and a turtle shell on his back. He usually wields a walking stick. His companions are usually Oolong, Umigame and Lunch.

 The dragon of the Zodiac and the private doctor to the Souma clan. Hatori is serious and is often without a sense of humor. It's his job to erase the memories of those who discover the Souma clan secret, though it is not entirely clear if this is simply a form of hypnosis or more of a supernatural power. When his curse activates he turns into a seahorse rather than an actual dragon, because the Chinese consider the seahorse to be baby dragons and the actual name in Japanese translates to it. He is very self-conscious about his transformation in the fact that he is the ""great and powerful dragon"" but appears as a ""seahorse."" He has had a bad experience in love with his ""Spring,"" a woman named Kana who was the assistant in his office. The relationship ended when Hatori asked Akito to give him permission to marry Kana. Akito threw a pot at Hatori and left him almost blind in the left eye. Kana felt so guilty about the incident and blamed herself completely. She was eventually driven insane with depression and guilt to the point where Hatori was forced to erase her memory in order to ease her suffering. Like Shigure and Ayame, he is very tall, and he is really a nice guy upon deeper inspection.

When Joseph asked him about a future meeting, Jesus made a map in the sand showing Joseph nine locations. 
  
 Jesus then traveled east across the continent, learning new languages and cultures until he reached the sea. Making a ship with the help of the locals, he set off across the sea to what would be known as America, where he lived, aged, and was finally put to rest. He seemed to have at least partial connection with the natives, who stated prior to his deathbed that they wished to see him. Shortly after his death, a large earthquake tore the ground apart, dividing his corpse by the movement of sand and relocating it to the different areas of America that would become the nine locations on Joseph of Arimathea's map.

He is a shadowy figure, with a black cloak, eerie black-and-white hair, a scar across his face and partially black skin. Black Jack cures patients indiscriminately, from common folk to presidents and yakuza leaders. To his VIP patients, he charges absurd sums. All this has given him a reputation for callousness and greed which he gleefully cultivates. However, to the reader it is clear that Black Jack actually is a good man: he is anti-wealth and anti-prestige, and believes he is actually doing rich people a favor by removing their material wealth. The opposition to wealth and power is a common theme in Tezuka's work: powerful men are almost always portrayed in a negative light.

 Birthday: June 18, 1984 
 Birthplace: Kanagawa-ken, Japan 
  
 Hiramaru was a salary man that hated working. On hearing Takagi and Mashiro talking about drawing manga on the subway and finding an abandoned copy of Jack, he quit his job to be a mangaka because he thought it would be less work for him. He is a different kind of genius compared to Eiji because he is talented even though he just started to write manga more in of a spur of the moment. 
  
 After teaching himself to draw manga in a very short amount of time, his manga, Otters 11 is serialized. He is hailed as a genius by Koji Yoshida who pushed for his serialization saying that Hiramaru had no real motivation to continue as a mangaka and failure would just make him quit. 
  
 Hiramaru is extremely lazy and immediately regrets getting serialized due to the amount of work to keep up a weekly series. He has said that he doesn't know why people have to work for a living and that he wants to sleep when he's tired and to eat when he's hungry. Due to his laziness, his editor, Koji Yoshida, often schemes to manipulate Hiramaru into working. Hiramura often tries to escape Yoshida to avoid working. His attempts to escape Yoshida is a long-running gag in the manga. 
  
 He is also a chronic hypochondriac and often makes incredible claims of illness. However, he is always proven healthy by the doctors. It's mostly believed that his ""illnesses"" are not only a product of his own fears, but also serves as an excuse to avoid work. 
  
 Hiramaru has a huge crush on Aoki Yuriko. Yoshida bribes him into doing work by giving him weekly facts about Aoki. Yoshida also often depicts dramatic scenarios of Aoki rejecting him due to his laziness or inability to produce names to energize him to work hard. Because he can't stand the idea of losing Aoki in his life, a combination of his own anxiety and Hiramaru's end-game scenarios, he works feverishly in hopes his work will earn Aoki's heart.","26 (debut), 34 (end)",,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/113540.jpg
1406,Sonic the Hedgehog(ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ),Sonic XSonic★the★HedgehogSonic: Night of the WereHog,1137,https://myanimelist.net/character/2882/Sonic_the_Hedgehog,"Age: 15 
 Occupation: Adventurer 
 Birthplace: Christmas Island 
 Alignment: Hero 
  
 Sonic the Hedgehog, nicknamed the ""Blue Blur,"" is well-known for his speed which is called ""second to none."" He made his first appearance in the game ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" for the Sega Genesis in 1991. Though he enjoys lazing around and simply enjoying himself, most of the games focus on the main antagonist Dr. Robotnik attempting to take over the world, only to be stopped by Sonic and occasionally several of his friends every time. 
  
 His best friend is Miles Prower, more commonly called Tails. Acting as somewhat of a sidekick and slowly maturing into more of a partner as the games go on, the young fox has a knack for inventing things and other machinery. 
  
 Lots of times he'll also team up with Knuckles the Echidna, guardian of the Master Emerald. He's been called his rival on several occasions and the two get along well (most of the time). 
  
 Sonic is prideful and hates to be constrained, enjoying freedom and doing things at his own pace (which is always incredibly fast). Though he is cocky and rather impatient, he is someone who would never turn their back on a friend in need or to protect the greater good (on several occasions performing actions that nearly result in his death). 
  
 Sonic mainly fights by curling into a ball and spinning at high speeds (known as the Spinball, Spin Dash, etc). He is also a master in Capoeira (a Brazilian martial art).

Despite being a duras, he is currently acting alongside the Gioh family. Though his true age is unknown, in human terms he appears to be a university student. Normally reserved and expressionless, Luka's facial expression softens around Yuki. It was during the Last Battle that Luka defected over to the humans. In the previous era, he and ""female"" Yuki were lovers. 
  
 Luka battles with a large black sword and can use powerful magic (and even summon a powerful Salamander dragon). He was once the loyal dog for the demon king and used to drink his blood, that's why he is stronger than any opasts and it's possible that he is stronger than the demon king himself. But he left his position as the loyal dog for the demon king after meeting Yuki. It was during the previous battle that Luka met Yuki and they fell in love. The current Yuki doesn't remember being Luka's lover, but every time he sees Luka his heart responds strongly. Luka refuses to tell Yuki about their past, but stands by the current male Yuki and promises he will stay with Yuki as long as Yuki wants him to. 
  
 The manga suggests a bit of a darker history. Luka tells Yuki he was considered a slave because he belonged to the ""sinner"" clan, Crosszeria, and that all the other duras were intent on punishing the whole family and all its descendants. The demon king owned Luka, and as a symbol of this, put his own blood into Luka's brand. The demon king's blood made the brand on Luka's arm glow red, and it caused Luka a great deal of pain during the process. Years later, Luka is still haunted by the memory and feels physically ill when recalling it. Because it was a blood seal, if Luka should ever betray the demon king, he would die. Luka explains to the current incarnation of Yuki that since he made a new contract with Yuki, the previous contract with the demon king was voided, allowing Luka to live. Luka hints that the prior contract with the demon king may not be ""completely"" voided, however. 
  
 His twin brother is Luze Crosszeria.

He is a very quiet individual, likely because the life of the ""Number Two"" does not allow him to have any close relationships with anyone, so when approached by others he says very little, if anything.

 He is a Featherweight boxer from the Naniwa Kentou Boxing Gym and a former JBC Featherweight Champion. He played the main antagonist during the events of championship road, serving as the second Japanese champion Ippo faced for the title. 
 Sendo's father was a fireman who died while saving the life of a child. Like Ippo, Sendo looked up to his father greatly, and this loss inspired him to try to be as strong as his father. 
  
 Sendo is an In-Fighter/Brawler with arm strength on par with Makunouchi Ippo or even more Raw Strengh than Ippo. To date, he is the only boxer to face Ippo more than once in the pro ring and is his chief rival. Sendo is a featherweight and his most well known move is his powerful smash. He greatly admires boxer Rocky Marciano, to the extent that he will personally point out that he is not the same ""Rocky"" from the film of the same name. He is also a fan of Takamura Mamoru. 
  
 He is first introduced watching a tape of Makunouchi Ippo's spectacular KO victory against Mashiba Ryou and, fired up by the tape, decides to go visit Tokyo for a match against Ippo. He leaves half-disappointed however when he learns of Ippo's broken fist, but declares hopefully to Ippo that he would be ""waiting for [him] in Osaka'"" when the time comes for their match, accidentally leaving a bag of souvenirs at the station upon his leave. 
  
 Since young, Sendo was known to be rude and problematic, having lead his own delinquent gang in the streets. However, it is mentioned by his grandma that Sendo did so to protect innocent civilians from other delinquent gangs. He and his grandmother run a market place. 
  
 Disheartened, Sendo does not put much effort into his training until a package arrives in the mail, along with a letter from Ippo stating that they may be able to have their match after all. Renewed by the prospective match Sendo quickly jumps back into intense training, waiting for the day of his match against Ippo.",,,,"167.5 cm (5'5"")","Professional Boxer, Marketplace Owner (with grandmother)",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/70383.jpg

  Weight : 53 kg 
  
 The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki (ユッキー, Yukkī), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary. 
  
 Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him. Despite this, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/134331.jpg

It is implied that she is the last remaining vampire and called ""the only remaining original."" Saya has no weakness to sunlight, although it is unknown if she has any of the other vulnerabilities often attributed to vampires. She does, however, become distressed when she encounters religious paraphernalia and angry when people mention God in her presence. Saya displays superhuman senses and strength, as well as cunning, resourcefulness, and skill. 
  
 The manga series suggests she was a human-vampire hybrid. Her age is unknown, but a picture of her with nine other people is shown in the film with the date 1892 and the word ""vampire"" attached to it. Though she holds most humans in contempt, she seems to have some sort of respect for David.

1423,Elizabeth(エリザベス / 江蓮),Gintama Movie 1: Shinyaku Benizakura-henGintamaGintama: Nanigoto mo Saisho ga Kanjin nanode Tashou Senobisuru Kurai ga Choudoyoi,1113,https://myanimelist.net/character/2946/Elizabeth,"Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen. 
  
 Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes. 
  
 When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai. 
  
 Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

She is a student with a strong sense of competitiveness which led to her popular nickname, much to her chagrin.

 When Hina was looking for Nitta, Hitomi was forced to help her. While waiting for Hina at Utako's Bar ""Little Song"", a regular customer at the bar started teaching her how to mix cocktails, revealing her talent (in doing actually everything).

 He is the main character, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. His affectionate name is Shin-chan. He loves Chocobis and an animated superhero named ""Action Kamen."" He is attracted to older girls and women, despite his young age. He brazenly pursues any girl who catches his eye. He shares this trait with his father and paternal grandfather, but this often results in Mom's cruel punishment. The only girl he seems to really like is a college student named Nanako. Some of his strange activities include dressing up and mooning. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at various activities including kendo. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness (for example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes), but these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. 
  
 There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others. For example, during the trip to Australia where he bumps into Kazama, he kindheartedly arranged for Kazama's father to play ball with his son after Shin-chan notices him being sad on the beach.

Their artificial spirits also allow them to access the dream worlds where such trees are located. Suiseiseki must call upon her artificial spirit to summon her watering can which she uses to nourish the ""soul trees"" and to launch her plant attacks. She makes an impression with her high-pitched voice, heterochromatic eyes (her left eye is green and her right eye is red), and frequent use of the sentence-ending copula ""desu"". She is described by Shinku as ""the most timid and shy of the sisters"" in the first season and even as a crybaby in Ouvertüre. She is quite easily scared of strange noises, and prefers to hide behind her sisters in the presence of strangers. With those she is acquainted however, she shows a very devious personality. Suiseiseki adores the spotlight, and her favorite activities include smashing the window of Jun's room (hitting Jun in the process frequently), picking mercilessly on Hinaichigo, and cackling maniacally. She has a wild imagination, a short temper and a fondness for telling wild lies to terrify Hinaichigo, whom she calls either ""chibi-chibi"" (tiny tiny) or ""chibi-ichigo"" (tiny strawberry). For the most part, Suiseiseki and Jun seem incapable of being civil with each other; she refuses to call Jun by name, opting for ""runt"" (""chibi-ningen,"" which translates to ""little human"") instead. 
  
 Despite her attitude towards Jun, she does care a great deal for him, and her attempts to cover that up usually manifest in the form of more insults. In Rozen Maiden träumend, Suiseiseki stands out among the dolls in that she values her sisters' love more than the goal of becoming Alice. She is one of the few dolls who opposes the Alice Game, and has no intentions of becoming Alice if it means taking her fellow sisters' Rosa Mystica. Suiseiseki and Jun attempt, without much success, to convince the other Rozen Maidens that the Alice Game is a meaningless endeavor. In her brief appearance in the OVA, she makes the same appeal to her twin several times. 
  
 Suiseiseki tries to avoid participating in the Alice Game as much as possible, but she can use her watering can to make plants emerge from the ground and manipulate them. Her artificial spirit is named after the popular Anna Sui perfume. Suiseiseki was also the winner for Saimoe 2006. 
  
 Medium: None (First Season)/Jun (Second Season) 
 Artificial Spirit: Sui Dream (""Sui"" can mean Amethyst or Jade; called ""Sweet Dream"" in Tokyopop translation.) 
  
 Suiseiseki's name in English means, ""Jade Stone.""

1436,Keroberos(ケルベロス),Cardcaptor SakuraCardcaptor Sakura Movie 1Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: Fuuin Sareta Card,1097,https://myanimelist.net/character/2897/Keroberos,"Favorite color: Red, Orange 
 Favorite flower: sunflower 
 Favorite food: sweet food 
 Favorite hobby: TV games 
 Favorite programs: comedies 
 Residency: currently in Sakura's room 
 Real appearance: A large lion-like animal with armour 
  
 Cerberus, nicknamed ""Kero,"" is the appointed guardian of the book which holds the Clow Cards. He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his ""brother"" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the final judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear. 
  
 Having spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in Osaka, Cerberus speaks with a pointed Osakan-accent. He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical, and a glutton, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger. He becomes very fond of video games, and is addicted to sweets. Cerberus spends most of his time in a ""false form"", a small figure resembling an orange-stuffed animal with wings. Unlike Yue, Cerberus draws his life energy from the sun and is not dependent on the magical power of his master. However, his master must have control of the Firey and Light cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged cat. In the anime adaptation, the Firey card is changed to the Earthy card to avoid to delay his obtaining his true form. Cerberus' name is taken from the Greek mythological figure, Cerberus, a large three-headed beast who was assigned to guard the gates of Hades. 
  
 In the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by Aya Hisakawa, while his hidden form is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In the English release of the anime adaptation, his name is spelled Kerberos. In the English adaptation, Cardcaptors, it is changed to Keroberos. His false form is voiced by Matt Hill and Richard Newman voices his true form. In the second film, he is voiced by Wendee Lee and Dave Wittenberg, in his respective forms.

 At the age where all quirks manifest, it seems as though Chisaki's dangerous and destructive ""Overhaul"" manifested and brutalized his parents. Alone in the world, he was adopted by the elderly head of the Shie Hassaikai, and from then on Chisaki held a deep-seated hatred of the genetic mutations which ruined his life. The psychological scars this left him with cause Chisaki to break out into hives whenever he is touched; his personality manifests this as repulsion towards germs, which bleeds into his views on quirks. 
  
 Chisaki has many dreams: to revert humanity back to a quirkless state, to repay the boss for saving his life, and to become head of the criminal underworld. Using Eri, the granddaughter of the boss, and her ""Rewind,"" Chisaki believes her power and his might be the key to realizing these goals at last. 
  
 As Deku and co. tangled with Chisaki and his devastating power, the young head deteriorated the more he is impeded, touched, and backed into a corner, until by the end he'd become everything the Yakuza avoided to be: an inhuman, power-hungry force of nature.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/363701.jpg

 Zodiac sign: Libra 
 Height: 172 cm 
 Weight: 57 kg 
 Occupation: Lieutenant of the 10th Division 
  
 Rangiku is an attractive woman with long, wavy, strawberry-blonde hair (worn short in her youth), icy blue eyes, and a beauty spot to the right of her mouth. Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm. 
  
 Rangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink saké. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.",,,,172 cm,Lieutenant of the 10th Division,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/520193.jpg

 Known as the ""Galactic Fairy,"" she is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet. She constantly tops music charts, and it is said that it is impossible not to hear her songs if you live in this galaxy. Naturally, her popularity is soaring high in Galaxy's sister fleet, Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl has recognized the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her 'behind the scenes' to realize her dream of singing.

She is a high school first year who claims her 3 great desires are video games, cat, and chocolate.

She is logical and a very caring person who can't leave her troubled friends. Her biggest fear are cockroaches.

He is a bit of a joker but when the time comes, he's all business. His number is 42-42-564 (shini-shini-koroshi), which literally means die-die-kill in Japanese. He has a special move called a ""Direct Noggin Shinigami Chop"" (which is normally shown when the Shinigami shows his hand, which is a large, flat, four-fingered hand appearing from his robe). This is both a joke and a real move. He constantly has to put up with Death Scythe's antics when it comes to Maka or her progress. He seems to take on a more playful attitude when talking with his son, Death the Kid (he says he likes his son's three white stripes). Shinigami's soul wavelength is so large that it entirely covers Death city.

 A psychic girl with a goth-like appearance who has the ability to sense people's ""auras"" and send out electric waves (denpa). Much like Arisa, Saki is extremely protective of Tooru, who was the first person in school who had truly accepted her. She is very observant, polite and loves to eat (and is rarely seen not eating outside of school). Her nickname Hana-chan and her manga symbol, a violet with fangs, relate humorously in that hana means ""flower"" in Japanese. 
  
 Hanajima has a close relationship with her family who accepts and even nurtures her gifts. Her younger brother, Megumi, looks up to Saki and has his own special ability so that she won't be the only ""weird"" one in the family. Her mother seems to resemble Tooru's protective and caring nature (possibly explaining her attachment to Tooru). In the near ""parental"" protection she and Arisa give Tooru, she acts as the protective ""motherly"" figure. When Kazuma comes in for Kyou's parent/teacher conference, Hana notes that he is ""handsome."" Kyou is not too keen on the idea of Saki as his ""mother.""

1454,"Nougami, Neuro(脳噛 ネウロ)",Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro,1080,https://myanimelist.net/character/4479/Neuro_Nougami,"The title character of the series, Neuro is a demon detective from hell. He looks for mysteries in the labyrinthine minds of humans for sustenance. When he dismantles the mystery and strips the culprit of all of their defenses, that releases the negative energies that caused the culprit to commit the crime, which he then consumes. He came to the human world in search of the Ultimate Mystery, as all of the mysteries in hell were bland and repetitive. Once in the human world, he forced Yako to be his assistant, and began to solve mysteries. 
  
 He is a very self-centered, sadistic and arrogant character that cares little about the human aspect of the cases, most of the time only focusing about getting the mystery as quick possible. This can be a disadvantage, however, as he can't relate to or begin to understand the motives of the culprits. He will also commit blackmail and manipulation to achieve his goals. Neuro enjoys abusing and torturing Yako at every chance he gets, and thinks of her as nothing more than a slave to use at the beginning of their 'partnership'. However, recently, there have been a handful of times where he seems to care for her: saving her from injury more than once by explosions, comforting her crudely at the end of the Hal arc, and even stating during his battle with X that seeing her struggling to find her own potential was ""very pleasant"". A little before the HAL arc he was constantly telling her to 'evolve' and become more useful to him. From his actions then, it is possible that Neuro expects quite a bit from Yako, expressing disappointment, approval and even pride at certain times. 
  
 In public Neuro makes Yako act as the detective, while he acts as her assistant, even though Neuro is actually doing all the detective work. Even though Neuro is a demon, he still needs to sleep but not as long as humans; though the more he is more exhausted, the more he shall sleep. According to Neuro ""Shouki is like Oxygen to a demon"" and natural hot springs are formed when excess Shouki comes to the surface, so the best place for him to sleep is near a hot spring. 
  
 Neuro's true form appears to be some kind of horned bird, often revealed when he is about to feed on the released negative energy. In the manga, unlike the anime, Neuro isn't limited to eating mysteries made by crimes; he has, on at least three occasions, completely disassembled various things to find out how they worked, such as a car, a cellphone, and even a bomb. 
  
 As a demon, he shows his inhuman abilities in the early chapters of the series, making him seemingly invincible against human weapons such as catching a bullet with just his eyelashes but as the story progresses, Neuro has received injuries by several criminals. Neuro implies this to X that his body is gradually becoming more like a humans, because of the lack of the Demon's world's Shouki in the human world and that his body is adjusting to the Laws of Physics in the human world. His monstrous endurance remains and ensures his survival longer than what would have killed an ordinary human. Even while his body is weakening, Neuro still was able to easily defeat X in combat.

 Konan is the partner of the Akatsuki leader, Pain, and the only female ninja in Akatsuki. She was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars, forcing her to fend for herself until being found by Jiraiya. Jiraiya trained Konan to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, and as a result paper is a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless numbers of paper sheets, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area or form weapons for attack. She can even form wings that mirror her title as ""God's Angel"" amongst the villagers of Amegakure, as she often carries out Pain's, who has the title of ""God,"" will. Her abilities are constrained while wet, as paper clings to itself and loses its stiffness.

1461,"Hakubi, Ryouko(白眉 魎呼)",Shin Tenchi Muyou!Tenchi Muyou! RyououkiTenchi Muyou! Ryououki 2nd Season,1075,https://myanimelist.net/character/4322/Ryouko_Hakubi,"Ryoko is known as Ryoko Hakubi, a space pirate who was defeated by Yosho nearly 700 years before her release by Tenchi. Before that, she was a slave to Kagato. Her age is at least 5,000 - although she claims to be only 2,000. She was created by Washu, using one of her egg cells as a base, so she is indirectly Washu's daughter. Washu's DNA was combined with that of amorphous creatures called the Masu to create Ryoko. She has three red gems that are the source of her full energy, which also came from Washu. 
  
 True to the meaning of her nomenclature, the gem on the inside of Ryoko's left wrist allows her to summon powerful, ferocious 'demon' spirits, which let physical attacks pass right through them, while the gem on the inside of her right wrist allows her to control the summoned spirits, and the last gem, which goes on her throat, gives her full power. She also has the ability to create false gems, one that she keeps hidden in plain sight on her left ear as an earring. This false gem is not as powerful as the originals, but allow her to balance her power and abilities. False gems also last for only a limited time, while the originals have an inexhaustible supply of energy. In OAV 3, it was revealed that the true gems contain the powers and godhead of Washu-kami-sama (who is one of the three Chousin Goddesses). It is debatable just how much of her mother's power she is borrowing and how much she is capable of using on her own, but her relatively young age (she appears about twenty years old) prevents her from drawing upon their full power. 
  
 Other powers Ryoko possesses include flight, teleporting, intangibility, creating energy swords and energy blasts (All regularly used), instantly regenerating missing limbs (Episode 1), creating doppelgängers (Episode 7), telekinesis, creating forcefields, matter formation (manipulating matter and merging with it, as with a stone pillar in Episode 6), complex molecular restructuring (repairing Mihoshi's GXP scanner in Episode 4), hair needles she can fire from her head (Episode 11), and telepathy with Washu and Ryo-Ohki. In addition she can access an advanced internal database, as a group-mind shared with Ryo-Ohki (Episode 14) to constantly overview her exact universal coordinates (and presumably other advanced functions/information in addition). Some of these abilities are known to have been inherited from Washu, while others are likely the result of her Masu genes, or intended design. It is possible that she gained shapeshifting abilities from merging with Zero (Episode 12), in combination with her amorphous masu heritage. 
  
 As a character, Ryoko is very emotional. She easily gets upset, and is short tempered, especially around Ayeka. But she's deeply in love with Tenchi, though not fully admitting how deeply until Episodes 5 & 6, when she tells Ayeka how she first met Tenchi, and later when she offers up her own life in place of his. While she was trapped in the cave, she was able to create an astral body (sort of like a ghostly consciousness) and venture to the entrance of the cave. She watched Tenchi grow up over the years, and she wished more than anything to be with him. However, the way she introduced herself to him was terribly frightening to Tenchi, so he distanced himself from her for a long time. Also, when Washu is first introduced she tells Ryoko that she knows how she (Ryoko) feels about Tenchi and says that Ryoko wants to do ""this and that"" with Tenchi. 
  
 Ryoko also has a bit of an ambiguous relation with Washu, her mother. When Washu first appears, she critiques her daughter's sex appeal and asks Ryoko to refer to her as ""mommy."" As the series progresses, she starts to fear Washu, especially when Washu starts doing some of her experiments on an unwilling Ryoko. In fact, Ryoko becomes slightly cautious whenever Washu is looking at her with a mischievous smile and intimidating eyes. 
  
 Physically, Ryoko has no taste buds, and has no need to eat; all the energy she gets comes from the gem created by Washu on her wrist. Ryoko eats to be social, but has a taste for sake. Although she can get drunk like normal humans, Ryoko has the ability to nullify the effects of alcohol, which comes in handy if she has to go into battle. She can also instantly nullify any other toxic chemicals within her body. In addition, Ryoko does not need to breathe, and can survive unaided in the vacuum of space. 
  
 Ryoko, when kidnapped and electrocuted by Ayeka, seemed to enjoy it. Ayeka called her a masochist, and Ryoko quipped that she was more of a sadist. Judging by the fact that her ship Ryo-Ohki destroyed 28 planets and 69 colonies when in Kagato's service, and by some of her taunts in the fight with Tenchi, she might not have been joking. Ryoko is also sometimes rather childlike, and can be a bit gullible. Since most of her life was spent either working under Kagato, or sealed inside a cave, she does not have much of a range of experiences. She is also extremely sensitive about her age, being brought to tears when Ayeka called her a mummy. 
  
 In ""Ai Tenchi Muyo"" she is now seen constantly wearing an elaborately designed leotard with matching white leg boots, her hair style is much simpler compared to her old hair style in past ""Tenchi Muyo"" series.

 Mamoru Chiba is the major romantic interest of Usagi Tsukino. He is often portrayed as stoic, steady and introverted. This may be because when he was young his parents died in a car crash. This blocked his childhood memories of his current lifetime and opened up the memories of his previous life as Prince Endymion. Tuxedo Mask is a disguise Mamoru created for himself in order to hunt for the Silver Crystal incognito and, later, assist the Sailor Senshi in battle. 
  
 He is always addressed as Mamo-chan by Usagi throughout the series (Chibiusa also addresses him with this nickname later on). After dating for two years, Mamoru gives Usagi an engagement ring at an airport. The couple eventually gets married. In the future, they become king and queen of Earth and Crystal Tokyo and have a child together whom they name, Small Lady, but is in the majority of the series known as Chibiusa. 
  
 The manga develops Mamoru more extensively, showing that the car crash happened on his birthday and gives a glimpse of his parents. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), heal people, and monitor the status of the Earth. The anime tends not to develop Mamoru as much; however, he is shown to be more social than his manga counterpart. He's interested in a variety of subjects and is shown as smart. 
  
 Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.

 Huan Yi is a Vice General who serves in Great General Mou Gou's army. In the past, he was a bandit leader with the moniker Huan Yi the Beheader. 
  
 His personality is said to be extremely brutal as he has no qualms in killing surrendered soldiers and personally beheaded every person in any city or village he conquered. This is shown in how he sends Wei soldiers, who have been severely tortured, along with bags of eyeballs back to their camp to decrease morale and incite fear. 
  
 He always has an arrogant smirk on his face and talks in a crude manner at times. He shows no respect for his foes as he calls Gen Bou ""an old fart"" and ""trash"" before killing him. He is exhibits a sense of humor and sarcasm as in the case when a fellow crew member asked him why he made an unskilled man named Ogiko as 1000-man commander of The Huan Yi army, he replied ""Gyahaha cause it's funny obviously."" 
  
 He also has a cool demeanor and almost never displays any shock no matter how bad the situation is. Huan Yi also shows a very dark side as he toys with Haku Kisai by dangling the idea of escape from death if he begged for his life then stabbed him several times after he refused to grovel. 
  
 He does exhibits a sense of loyalty exclusive to Mou Gou by holding the rank of Vice General in his army and coming when summoned as demonstrated when Chou Tou used Mou Gou's name, as he knew that Huan Yi would simply ignore an request for a conversation with him.

  Food he dislikes: Fat in meat 
  Favorite Proverb: ""Neither doctors nor the Kusatsu Hot Springs can cure the illness called love."" and every positive proverb about love. 
  
  
 A young underground doctor who lives with Celty and is also her lover. 
 He mostly remains indoors and wears his white doctor's coat even when he is not at work. 
  
 He went to the same primary school as Shizuo and Izaya and finds them interesting, enjoying their fights ... up to a point. 
  
 His father was also a doctor, and as a child Shinra participated in surgery alongside him, the most notable being an autopsy on Celty when they first met. 
 As a doctor he is rather interested in what he considers to be interesting phenomena, such as the unlimited strength Shizuo shows in times of anger, and Celty's healing, headlessness and bodily functions. 
  
 Shinra seems to have the ""capacity"" to tell what Celty is feeling, much to her surprise since she doesn't have a head to show her emotions.

 Tota is known as the most outspoken member in the investigation team. He plays a crucial role in the investigation of the Yotsuba Group after sneaking into the company's building without the knowledge of the team. His designated investigation team alias is Taro Matsui. 
  
 By following L's instructions, Matsuda gains the trust of the company's board members, fabricates his death (he uses the alias Taro Matsui) so that Yotsuba members can not kill him), and serves as a temporary decoy to lure the suspect into the Sakura television studio during the second Sakura TV incident. Despite his excitable, naïve personality, Matsuda manages to stay alive through quite a few dangerous times. Matsuda sees Soichiro as his mentor. 
  
 While it is clear that most of the investigation team views Kira as a an evil criminal, Matsuda often wonders if Kira is performing good deeds, especially since more and more people seem to be agreeing with what he does. Matsuda is scared by Mikami's intense loyalty to Kira when he hears Mikami's public announcement on Sakura TV.

 Before joining Shohoku, Mitsui Hisashi was an MVP for Takeishi Junior High. Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year. 
  
 Although he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself. 
  
 Afterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang—Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma—voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again. 
  
 Mitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable—he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.

1480,Tachikoma(タチコマ),Koukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex - Tachikoma na HibiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society - Uchikoma na HibiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG - Tachikoma na Hibi,1062,https://myanimelist.net/character/4808/Tachikoma,"A Tachikoma is an AI walker/roller tank in the Ghost in the Shell universe, appearing only in the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex sub-universe. They are best described as a ""spider type multi leg/multi ped combat vehicle equipped with artificial intelligence,"" possessing the ability to act as both personnel transport units and mobile weapons platforms. 
  
 Design: 
  
 Tachikoma are the size of a small car, and are of a middle-blue color, with four ""eyes"" fitted on the surface of their bodies. Three are on the ""head"" and one is beneath the abdomen. Each eye has three pinholes, possibly for triangulation. These eyes sometimes become expressive in the typical anime style. Tachikoma are controlled by individual AIs, are capable of speech and generally exhibit a childish, curious, joyful and active personality, although they are consummate professionals in the field. They normally operate as independent units and receive orders from human agents, but they can also be directly piloted from a cockpit in their abdomen. 
  
 Tachikoma have four legs and two arms. They can move by walking, or they can drive at high speed by using the wheeled footpads on each of their four legs. They are apparently street-legal (presuming no legal exemption for Section 9). Each wheel appears to be angled and omnidirectional, allowing the Tachikomas to move in any direction with their holonomic drive system. Other abilities of the Tachikoma include jumping great distances, sticking to vertical or inverted surfaces, engaging a thermoptic camouflage mechanism, and grappling/rappelling using their adhesive string launchers. Tachikoma maintain control of their legs while using wheels to drive down a road, and shift their weight around turns. They can also roll briefly on to two legs while driving to avoid an obstacle or pass through a narrow space. To make balance easier, they can move their heavy abdomens with a ball joint. Their movements when walking and jumping were modelled on a jumping spider. Almost all of the Tachikomas' physical abilities are showcased in Episode 2 of Stand Alone Complex, ""Runaway Evidence - Testation."" 
  
 Standard Tachikoma equipment includes a 7.62x51mm light machine gun mounted in the right arm, a secondary weapon hardpoint in the ""snout"" (usually a 50mm grenade launcher, capable of launching both explosive and gas grenades, but which can be replaced by a six-barrelled 12.7x99mm Gatling gun), a universal cybernetic connector on an extensible, prehensile cable in the left arm, and a built-in thermoptic camouflage system. 
  
 AI: 
  
 Tachikoma's are gifted with very childlike AI, unexpected of a machine in a governmental special forces team, which gives rise to much of the comedy relief in Stand Alone Complex. Though they possess individual artificial intelligence, every night they are synchronized, so they start the next day with identical consciousnesses that are each the sum of their total collective experience & development. This leads to identity confusion, since each Tachikoma has the same memories.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/98448.jpg

1483,Kon(コン),BleachBleach: Memories in the RainBleach: The Sealed Sword Frenzy,1060,https://myanimelist.net/character/1089/Kon,"Birthday: December 30 
  
 Kon primarily serves as a comedic foil in the series; when not inhabiting Ichigo's body, his normal plushie body is treated with little respect and much disdain. The humorously cruel treatment he is always subjected to provides the comic relief in Bleach. One of the only people who gives him any respect is Chad; however, Chad ignores him most of the time. His plushie body is a knock-off of the main character of the popular TV show Carnivore Kingdom, named ""Ponkichi,"" which happens to be Chad's favorite show. It was a prize from the shooting game in the Karakura Town Festival. He is constantly stepped on and torn, at which point Ichigo will have Uryū Ishida repair the plushie. Uryū usually adds something unwanted or unnecessary when doing so, such as dressing Kon up like a designer doll. Uryū also sewed a Quincy cross on the back of Kon's head as revenge after Kon attacked Uryū for turning him into a doll. 
  
 Kon is quite perverted and often takes advantage of his form to get girls to hug him to their chests, which rarely goes as planned. After Ichigo becomes less dependent on Kon to transform, Kon comments on how he wouldn't mind taking Ichigo's body out for a spin again, saying that he'd like go peeping and pulling up skirts because, as he puts it, ""It's [Ichigo's] reputation that gets sullied."" Kon is very fond of Rukia, calling her ""sister,"" though this extends to basically any pretty girl. 
  
 Kon is a special type of soul pill called a ""modified soul"" or ""ModSoul."" When inserted into a body, an aspect of the body is made superhuman, which in Kon's case is enhanced speed and strength. Because of the shady origins of the ModSoul, the soul society called for the destruction of all ModSoul pills, but luckily, Kon was shipped out with a load of regular soul pills by mistake. This gives rise to his belief that everyone should be given a chance at life and should not be killed merely based on the circumstances of their origins. 
  
 His name ""Kon"", which was given to him by Ichigo, comes from the word ""Konpaku"" within the term ""Kaizou Konpaku,"" the Japanese name for ""modified soul."" Kon wanted his name to be ""Kai"" from ""Kaizou"" because it sounded cooler, with which Ichigo agreed, but at the same time refused to name him that so as to not give him any satisfaction.

 Birthday: May 17, 1995 
  
 The main protagonist and the storyteller of the series. He is in his second year at Fumizuki Gakuen's High School and is an F-Class student. 
  
 Although he denies it, he is a rarely found 'fool' who even his own parents call him as ""the fool over all the world."" Not only are his grades the lowest, but he's really so stupid that he is titled the ""Kansatsu Shobunsha (under observation)"" from the school. For him his own safety is the most important thing and does not hesitate to use the most cowardly ways if needed, in circumstances where his harm is unnecessary. 
  
 However, he also has a righteous heart that can stand up against for other friends (except Yuuji). Even going as far as selflessly putting himself in harms way to help others, with no significant gain in sight for himself. Though shown he can have a perverted/active side, he's usually peaceful, gentle, kind and quiet towards those around him, which gains him certain popularity. 
  
 On the outside he is quite a bishounen, but is frequently thought (mostly by female students) to look better in a girl's outfit, and such photos and merchandise of him are secretly sold by Mutsurini—dubbed the hidden idol ""Aki-chan."" 
  
 He admires Mizuki but does not even dream of receiving love from her. While Minami has a heart for Yoshii, he thinks that he is hated by her after a series of events that almost killed him. 
  
 He entered Fumizuki Gakuen because his parents thought it was cheap. Yoshii's parents live overseas because of work, and for this reason he lives by himself. With nobody looking after him, he used up all his money for personal use and therefore was living in a poverty. His main food used to be salt and water—until his older sister returned back to Japan. Thanks to her supervision he couldn't spend money as he wished so his meals became normal once again. 
  
 However, because his sister and mother's housework abilities were zero, Yoshii is quite an expert when it comes to such areas. He is especially skilled in cooking. 
  
 He is right-handed, but he used to be a lefty (so says he). 
  
 Although his shoukanjuu's battle level is the lowest, he can comfortably stand up against high-class shoukanjuus thanks to his fluent ability to control it; however, because he is the Kansatsu Shobunsha, the fatigue and damage experienced by his shoukanjuu is returned to himself, he tries to avoid summoning during battles if not necessary. 
  
 Shoukanjuu's weapon is a modified Gakuran and a wooden sword. The Occult version is ""Dullahan (headless knight),"" influenced from the feature that ""No head=fool."" As told by Gakuen Principal, he is the one that is ""distorting the essence of the Test Summon System."" 
  
 As a side note, Yoshii placed 8th of the male characters and 13th overall in the 2009 edition of ""Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!""

 Height: 170 cm (5'7"") 
 Weight: 58 kg 
 Blood type: A 
 Species: human 
 Affiliations: Raizen High School, Ratatoskr 
 Favorite quote: ""If people refuse to accept you, I'll just accept you even more."" 
  
 The main protagonist of the story, Shidou is a student of Raizen High School. He was adopted into the Itsuka family when he was ""abandoned"" by his mother. He possesses a strange power that allows him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss; however, the seal will only work if the Spirit holds enough trust or affection toward him to allow it. Although considering trust and affection is a two-way street he probably needs to have a certain amount of affection too, or at least genuinely want to help the spirit from the bottom of his heart which he usually does even before seeking out a spirit. 
  
 Due to this power which was already known by Kotori Itsuka he was recruited—or rather forced—to join ""Ratatoskr"" to help and save Spirits. Instead of killing Spirits to prevent spacequake from happening, he has to seal the Spirit's powers with a kiss in order for them to co-exist with humans.",16,,,"170 cm (5'7"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/202607.jpg
1490,Kurogane(黒鋼),Tsubasa ChronicleTsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no HimegimiTsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season,1052,https://myanimelist.net/character/129/Kurogane,"Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran's fighting ability (along with Syaoran's blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite's true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran's sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as ""Kuro-puu"", ""Kuro-wan-wan"" or ""Kuro-rin"". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane's own statement that ""If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I'll kill them too"". 
  
 His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' ""death"" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle. 
  
 He obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/77672.jpg

 Birthday: November 1 
 Age: 15 (series), 16 (movie) 
 Ethnicity: Japanese descent 
 Place of origin: L1 Colony Cluster 
 Hair: Brown 
 Eyes: Prussian Blue 
 Bio/Notes: Pilot of the Wing Gundam and Wing Zero. Heero is known as ""The Perfect Soldier,"" having been trained since he was very young for the battlefield. 
  
 Heero Yuy is nothing more than his code name, however, named for the fallen Colony leader who's assassination the Gundam Pilots were supposed to avenge. 
  
 After his arrival on Earth, Heero encounters Relena Darlian, the daughter of an Earth/Colony peace advocate. After enrolling in her school, Heero ends up saving her life on several occasions, causing him to confuse his mission and his feelings. 
  
 Heero's first ally is Duo Maxwell, who helps him pull his Gundam up from the ocean. Afterwards, he sets out on his own for a while, attacking bases and OZ encampments. 
  
 His primary rival is Zechs Merquise, and they have several battles throughout the series, even trading Gundams from time to time. His other rival is Treize Kushrenada, who gives him the purely evil Gundam Epyon, which he trades to Zechs for the Wing Zero. 
  
 Although Trowa Barton holds the most mystery to his personality, Heero comes a close second, always disappearing after completing a mission or having an encounter. He lives by his emotions as stated by himself several times within the series and always thinks things through most of the time.  He was also referred to as ""the heart of space"" by Quatre Raberba Winner, Pilot 04, near the end of the last episode.

He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies.
