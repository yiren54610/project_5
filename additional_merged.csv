 Fremy is the Saint of ""Powder."" Her unique heredity allowed her to receive from the god a type of power that no one ever received before her, as ""Powder"" isn't among the 78 officially known types of Saints. As such, she's also the only Saint who isn't under the supervision of Mora. Her power allows her to freely create explosives during battles, and greatly increases the damage caused by her gun's bullets. In Rokka no Yuusha's world, guns aren't powerful enough to injure a kyouma, but in Fremy's case, she can easily kill most of the kyouma as well as most armored humans in one single shot. But because her gun needs to be reloaded after every fired shot, she's weak in close combat - as well as when she's surrounded.",,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/88577/Fremy_Speeddraw: 'src'

 Birthday: June 1 
 Zodiac: Gemini 
 Height: 170 cm 
 Weight: 55 kg 
  
 Kamui is a member of the Yato Tribe, the son of Umibouzu and older brother of Kagura. His excellent fighting skills helped him become Captain of the 7th Division of Harusame's Thunder Guns, the most powerful combat unit within the Harusame group and Overlord of Yoshiwara. Since defecting from the Harusame, he no longer holds these positions. 
  
 Kamui firmly believes that the Yato are to remain on the battlefield and shows his disapproval of Housen staying locked up in Yoshiwara. Because of this belief, he shows no pity towards family or subordinates as a sign of weakness is unacceptable. He tried to revive the abandoned tradition of Yato clan's men killing their own parent to prove their strength, although failed to successfully execute it and only cut his father's arm off. 
  
 Despite this, he pays respect to the opponents he kills by sending them off with a smile. He doesn't kill children, and dislikes killing women because they may give birth to strong children.

 Maple/ Kaede Honjou is the main character, who has just started playing NewWorld Online. Since she doesn't like to get hurt, she puts every skill point she earns into boosting her defense, allowing her to acquire new skills and level up simply by withstanding attacks. Even with her lack of gaming experience, Maple remarkably gains enough resistance to almost anything, giving the game admins many headaches on how to slow her down; to which, her unorthodox methods overcomes the developers' adjustments. She seems to have an innate luck ability to locate rare items, hidden dungeons, and unique quests and skills (such as the Loving Sacrifice quest where she gains a second form).

1027,Batou(バトー),Koukaku KidoutaiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone ComplexInnocence,1746,https://myanimelist.net/character/2653/Batou,"Batou (also Batto, Bato) is nominally the second-in-command of Section 9.  Little is known about the strange, large foreigner who has been with Motoko Kusanagi for years.  He was once American and served in the Special Forces in South America.  His amount of cyborg-ization is variable according to the storyline, from his limbs only up to most of his body, second only to the Major herself.  Despite the availability of superior eyes, he grew superstitious about his old-style eye replacements, popular with many high-level military operatives.  He also retains some residual body-image issues, causing him to continually purchase workout equipment despite the obvious anachronism. 
  
 In the two Stand Alone Complex series, Batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. He is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. Being emotional and not as calm as the Major, Batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. He sometimes shows impatience with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly. 
  
 At times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the Major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. Both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each Gig. This tension is touched upon, briefly, in the Solid State Society movie, where Batou admits that he's been covering up any of the Major's appearances in cases prior to the Puppet Master case. 
  
 Batou had served in a military special forces team before entering Section 9. Most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. Despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, Batou lifts weights as a hobby. Based on several of the Stand Alone Complex episodes, Batou seems to have served in the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force at some point before he joined Section 9. It is suggested several times that he held a JGSDF Ranger qualification. His unit was involved in World War IV and was deployed to South America alongside Motoko Kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an American Imperial Navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed ""Project Sunset,"" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. Batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. They are standard cybernetic equipment issued to Ranger Special Forces operatives.

 Born in the noble realm, He doesn't care for class or your family name, only that you contribute to a better world. With this information, some fans believed that Julius may have been a peasant himself. 
  
 After successfully passing the Magic Knights exam, Julius joined the Grey Deer squad. Currently known as the Aqua Deer to fans of the show, Julius's squad possessed a number of notable characters. At some point, the Wizard King was chosen to lead the squad. 
  
 As Captain, Julius recruited Yami Sukehiro, current captain of the Black Bulls. Despite Yami being a foreigner who was ostracized by the kingdom, Julus recognized his potential. The two grew close and their friendship is a highlight of the show. Surprising to some viewers, Julius Novachrono didn't always want to become Wizard King. As a Royal Knight, he was happy in his role as it allowed him to satisfy his obsession with magic and meet powerful mages in the process. 
  
 As expected from the giant nerd, Julius possesses an incredible amount of magical knowledge, far surpassing that of the Magic Knights Captains. After Yuno gains a new power during the investigation of a dungeon, Julius immediately recognizes this as the wind spirit Sylph, despite the fact that Yuno knew very little about the power himself or how to even control it. 
  
 Additionally, the Wizard King managed to decipher an ancient magical item designed by the very first Wizard King over 500 years ago. But even Julius has his limits, such as when he was surprised by Asta's anti-magic sword. 
  
 Don't let his happy-go-lucky attitude deceive you, Julius can be ruthless when required. Throughout the anime, the Wizard King demonstrates kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Even when fighting Patolli, Julius preferred to capture him alive in order to save William's body. 
  
 However, this doesn't mean that he is soft. When the Eye of The Midnight Sun attacked the kingdom and captured Asta, in the blink of an eye Julius killed two members of the terrorist organization. The man is willing to take a life in order to save those he cares about.

After making their way to sector G, Crow destroyed the Necro Macro security robot which had been chasing Ganta, Shiro and Yoh. After a small skirmish, and an interruption by Shiro, Crow was subdued by the Deadman security. The next day, Ganta and Senji were slated to be the next two Deadmen to compete in the ""Carnival Corpse."" Despite Senji's experience and skill with his 'branch' ability, Ganta managed to win by fooling Senji. As a consequence for losing, Senji's right eye was removed for research. He returns a short time later during Ganta's next match, sporting an eyepatch and gives Ganta assistance with figuring out his opponent's techniques. He also helps Ganta understand his own capabilities. His change in personality toward Ganta is due to his respect for Ganta's strength. Senji comments that because Ganta beat him, he is not allowed to lose until they have a rematch. 
  
 He seems to thoroughly enjoy violence, and his favorite phrase is ""Dead Center."" Despite his wild and battle-hungry attitude, he does have a sense of honor and respects strength and determination. In an ironic twist, Senji becomes flustered and embarrassed when a woman acts immodest. When he first notices Shiro's form fitting body tights, his face becomes red and he give her his coat telling her to quickly cover up. 
  
 His Branch of Sin is called ""Crow Claw."" It manifests as two large scythe-like blades, made of blood, extending from long cuts on his forearms. He makes these cuts using two bladed rings he wears on his thumbs. While the blades are typically two to three feet long, Senji has demonstrated the ability to greatly lengthen them allowing him to attack people at range. He is responsible for naming Ganta's 'Branch of Sin' (Ganta Gun).  He also has a supersonic attack called Invisible Black. 
  
 Senji used to be a policeman before his time in DW. It's hinted that he killed four friends.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/120298.jpg

 Rea is friendly with everyone at the shrine, including Darin despite her intentions to use Rea as a research subject. She calls Mero by Mero-Chan similar to that of Mero's mother which causes Mero great discomfort at first. Similarly, she calls Darin with the -Chan suffix to Darin's discontent.

He has been fighting on the battlefields, using only his bare hands, since the age of sixteen, when he fought against both American and Vietcong in the Vietnam War. Since then, it appears that he has obtained respect from the American forces, and has begun fighting as a kind of mercenary for them. It is said that when he stopped fighting for survival but for pleasure, the image of the demon's face appeared on his back.

 She is a quiet, fragile and reclusive girl, and fraternal twin sister to the main protagonist. Cursed with illness and frailty since birth, Sora was denied the sort of independent life that many take for granted. Yet beneath Sora's angelic doll-like appearance lies a troublesome personality that’s prone to withdrawn laziness and demonstrates a rather severe lack of social graces. In all honesty, Sora doesn't care for anyone else, and would much rather just surf the Internet and eat instant food, for as long as Haruka is always by her side. It's implied that her strong bond with Haruka, strengthened as a result of the tragic loss of their parents, may be leading her towards fantasies of incest between twins. She hates Nao, although it is implied that they were once good friends. She is often seen carrying a rabbit doll, which she received as a present before she and Haruka left the village.

He'll go to any lengths to protect his loved ones... even when the interests of those closest to him come into irreconcilable conflict. 
  
 Shorter is clever, resourceful, and as tough as steel. He's equally skilled at brawling, shooting, and sneaking around like a shadowy thief. Shorter can disguise himself as a completely different person, and fool even Eiji into thinking that he is a dotty old Chinese man. 
  
 Shorter has an irrepressible sense of humor and can wear a lopsided, devilish grin even during the grimmest of circumstances. Like Ash, he is a charismatic leader who can easily unite the other kids on the street under his rule. 
  
 At the beginning of the series, Shorter has a mohawk hairdo. But by volume two he has shaved off all of his hair and is completely bald. Shorter's trademark fashion statement is his ever-present sunglasses. He even wears them while sneaking around a cornfield in the middle of the night! In an interview, Akimi Yoshida said that Shorter's character design was inspired by Sunplaza Nakano.

Katsu no wa Ore da",1685,https://myanimelist.net/character/4945/Broly,"Broly was the Legendary Super Saiyan born in more than a thousand years. At birth, he had an unusually high level of strength for a Saiyan. Broly's exceptional gifts marked him as being the Legendary Super Saiyan. King Vegeta feared this and ordered for his execution. His father, Paragus, begged to spare his life. King Vegeta ended the argument by blasting him. As Broly's execution was carried out both he and his father were left to die. While Paragus barely survived the blast, Broly survived the attempted execution only to grow stronger. On that same day, Frieza acted on his own fear of the Super Saiyan legend and attacks Planet Vegeta. Amid the destruction, Broly encased himself and his father in a powerful shield of energy and escaped. 
  
 As great as Broly's power was, his emotional instability was greater. Fearing Broly's state of mind, Paragus had a scientist create a special control device to keep Broly controlled. Successful in controlling him, Paragus planned to have revenge on King Vegeta's son. When Broly encountered Son Goku, Broly became erratic though he was brought back under control by Paragus. Eventually, Broly overpowered the control device, and fully manifested his powers. No longer under the device's control, he unleashed his fury on Goku, Vegeta, Son Gohan, Future Trunks, and Piccolo, and defeated them all. The Z warriors eventually channeled their energy into Goku, who used the energy for one last powerful blow that seemingly killed Broly. 
  
 Broly survived and entered a Saiyan Space Pod, coincidentally landing on Earth. The crater caused by his landing filled up with water and froze over time, during which he fell into a deep sleep. During this time, Gohan grew up, Son Goten was born and Goku was in the Afterlife. In an adventure to collect the Dragon Balls, Goten, Trunks, and Gohan find themselves in the mountain range where Broly crashed. Broly awakens and Goten, Trunks, Videl, and Gohan became victims to his rampage. It was only after some spiritual help from Goku that they were able to send Broly straight into the sun.

 Ren is, in outward appearances, an extremely nice and polite star; however, he shows his true self whenever he is around Kyouko. At the age of twenty, Ren has lived a large portion of his life in America. After Ren's encounter with Reino (from Vie Ghoul), it is revealed that ""Tsuruga Ren"" is only a stage name with his real name being Kuon Hizuri.",20-21,,,190 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/59129.jpg

 Zodiac sign: Pisces 
  
 Usami Akihiko is a 28 year old author. He was raised in England until he was 10, and later moved to Japan.  He graduated law school first of his class and is the youngest recipient of the Naomori Award. 
  
 He was a pure-hearted romanticist, as Takahashi Misaki, his love interest says. 
  
 He is extremely popular with his books, but also writes erotic (BL) Yaoi fiction under the pen name Akikawa Yayoi because it allows him to earn money on his fantasies. He is working for the Marukawa Publishing Co., and to his editors, he is known as a writer/author who doesn't meet deadlines. He comes from a rich and wealthy family and has a half-brother called Haruhiko. He first met Hiroki Kamijou in Japan in his secret base. He was a loner back then and always wanted to be alone. He also doesn't talk much because of his family circumstances. 
  
 Akihiko always wanted to have a normal life. He collects toys because it makes him feel like this is what ""normal childhood"" feels like. He named all his teddy bears Suzuki because to him it is the most common name in Japan. (It isn't.) 
  
 His nickname is ""Usagi"", which means ""rabbit"" in Japanese. Usagi has been Misaki's brother's best friend for over ten years, and was secretly in love with Misaki’s brother but never said anything about it. Due to Misaki's grade, Takahiro asks Usagi to become Misaki's tutor and assist him in raising his grades for the college entrance exams. Due to some twist of fate, Takahiro’s company transfers him away and, worried about the becoming of his little brother, Takahiro asks Usagi for Misaki to stay and live with him until he comes back or until Misaki can come live with him in Osaka.

And in helping her he also gets the chance to travel to the human world, somewhere he's always dreamed of going. 
  
 Staz is sometimes viewed by others as having a lazy look about him, though they never do well to underestimate him as he's also very powerful. He has rapid healing abilities, as well as the ability to paralyze weaker demons with his stare, he's able to control humans and alter memories with his saliva, can suck out other demon's magic with his teeth, and can crush someone's heart from afar. He sometimes says things like ""I might be a vampire, but first and foremost i'm me"" and once lost his temper and nearly killed his friend Wolf while they were fighting when he questioned Staz's reasons for helping Fuyumi, and then scoffed at his statement of being himself before being a vampire.

 Birthday: May 23 (Gemini) 
 Height: 4'11"" (152 cm) 
 Occupation: Student, Waitress 
 Affiliation: Minegahara High School, 1st year 
  
 Tomoe Koga (古賀 朋絵, Koga Tomoe) is one of the main characters of the Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume Wo Minai series. As a result of Adolescence Syndrome, Tomoe is capable of eliciting simulated future events. 
  
 Tomoe has a solid desire to fit in and avoid being shunned, so she bears unease over her past and why she cares about her social life and status; the latter is why she is usually on her phone. After her experience with Sakuta, she learned not to focus on what others think of her and thanked him for helping her grow as a person. 
  
 During her time in a middle school in Fukuoka, Tomoe was a bumpkin who hung out with an unnoticed group in her class. However, her father was relocated, which forced her to move to Tokyo. Fearing she would be considered uncool and get bullied, she began wearing makeup, styled her hair in a fancy salon, and wore clothes from fashion magazines. She became satisfied with the result.",,,,"4'11"" (152 cm)","Student, Waitress",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/366709.jpg

 Height: 180 cm (5'11"") 
 Blood Type: O 
 Initial Persona: Izanagi 
 Ultimate Persona: Izanagi-no-Okami 
 Weapons: Two-Handed Sword 
  
 The Protagonist is named by the player in the video game, but is given the name Souji Seta in the manga adaptation and Yuu Narukami in the anime. 
  
 He has silver hair with a shape close to a bowl cut. He is depicted as being a distant, but otherwise friendly, loner with a pessimistic outlook on life due to having to move frequently as a result of his parents' changing careers. 
  
 At the beginning of the game, he moves to the countryside to live with his uncle and cousin for a year, and attends Yasogami High School in the same homeroom  class as Chie, Yosuke, and Yukiko. 
  
 The story of Persona 4 begins when the Protagonist meets Igor and Margaret in the Velvet Room, in the form of a limousine driving in a thick fog; the shape of the Velvet Room changes based on its visitor. 
  
 The Protagonist's first Persona, Izanagi of the Fool Arcana, wears a long coat reminiscent of the Japanese bancho and wields the Amenonuhoko, which, in-game, is a spear with a blade resembling a combat knife. This Persona is later transformed into Izanagi-no-Okami of the World arcana, the game's most powerful Persona. 
  
 The Protagonist also has a unique ""wild card"" ability to swap Personas, similar to the main characters of previous Persona games, but without the power of Death at his hand, he cannot use Fusion spells like the Protagonist of Persona 3. 
  
 The characters of the story give the Protagonist titles ""senpai"", ""sensei"", ""leader"", ""partner"", ""big bro"" when directly talking to him, instead of the usual ""you"" or ""him"" like his predecessors. 
  
 The character design of the Protagonist stayed relatively similar from initial conception, with his tone and expressions changing the most.",,,,"180 cm (5'11"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/138009.jpg

 Minako is the fourth member of the Sailor Team to be discovered by Sailor Moon, and serves as the leader of the Guardian Senshi who protect her. She uses love-related powers. In the manga and anime series she dreams of becoming a famous idol, whereas in the live-action series her character is refactored to already be a celebrity. 
  
 Silly or serious, Minako consistently displays great confidence, enthusiasm, and leadership skill. She is the ""owner"" of Artemis, the white guardian cat who introduced her to her life as a Senshi. He lives in her home (as Luna lives in Usagi's) and is one of her closest friends.

 Height: 175 cm (5'8.5"") 
 Weight: 62 kg (136.4 lbs) 
 Specialty: sculptures 
  
 Morita occupies room 203, his floormates being Takemoto and Hasegawa. Morita is unable to graduate, as he can never wake up on time to go to classes. This is mainly due to the work that he does, which forces him to go missing for periods of time. What he does for work though remains a mystery. When Morita comes back from his mysterious job, he immediately falls asleep for at least 48 hours, due to the amount of work he does. He also returns with a large sum of money in his back-pocket and brings a food item to share with his flat mates. Although the flat mates believe he does it to mock them, such as when he brings a bag of croquettes instead of meat, Morita does care deeply for his friends such as Takemoto. 
  
 Morita is a very mysterious person. He does many random, crazy things for his personal enjoyment, such as creating a twister game with too many colors, which resulted in horrific pain for him and Takemoto. Morita is a perceptive individual, but tactless and often states the truth, such as how Mayama secretly stalks Rika outside her apartment, when nobody wants to hear it. He also expresses his love for Hagu in weird and quirky ways, such as forcing Hagu to dress up as a mouse. Morita's obsession with Hagu stems from a fondness of cute things during his childhood, such as causing a cat to become neurotic after cuddling it too much.",24,,,"175 cm (5'8.5"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/34899.jpg

 Makoto Kino, called Lita Kino in the original English dub, is a fourteen-year-old girl who is a student in Usagi Tsukino's class and was rumoured to have been expelled from her previous school for fighting. Unusually tall and strong for a Japanese schoolgirl, she transforms into Sailor Jupiter, the Guardian of Thunder and Courage. Both of Makoto's parents died in a plane crash years ago, so she lives alone and takes care of herself. She cultivates her physical strength and domestic interests, including housekeeping cooking, and gardening. Makoto excels at hand-to-hand combat. Her dream is to marry a young handsome man and to own a flower-and-cake shop.

 Mei is an honor student, the chairman's granddaughter, and student council president. She is stern, cold, and often calm and composed, but she can be rather sensitive and mature to some extent. At first, there is little to know about her and a bad impression of Mei washes over Yuzu, which causes Yuzu to take interest on Mei later on. Though Mei seems to be hard to approach, she is rather sensitive and lonely which makes Yuzu want to care for Mei more.

1083,"Okajima, Rokurou(岡島 緑郎)",Black LagoonBlack Lagoon: The Second BarrageBlack Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail,1627,https://myanimelist.net/character/459/Rokurou_Okajima,"Rokurou Okajima, also known as ""Rock,"" is the protagonist of the series. He was a Japanese salaryman for Asahi Industries in Tokyo until he was taken hostage by the crew of the Black Lagoon. He joined the Lagoon Company after his department chief, Kageyama, abandoned him in an attempt to cover up the smuggling operation in which Rock had been an unwitting participant. Rock is a humble and mild-mannered person despite being on the business end of guns from friend and foe alike, and often seems surprised at the barbarity of the Southeast Asian crime world. He still wears his tie, short-sleeved dress shirt, and dress pants because although now a pirate, he still retains his business persona. He prefers to use words over weapons when interacting with others. Rock, after joining the Lagoon company, has wondered if he is experiencing Stockholm syndrome. 
  
 Within the Lagoon Company, Rock is usually responsible for account management, diplomacy, negotiation, interpretation, and the occasional errand. Having once worked in the resource investigation department of Asahi Industries, Rock is also skilled in geology. He is also a skilled linguist, being effectively bilingual in Japanese (his native language) and English as well as being familiar with other languages, including Spanish, Romanian and Russian. He also has a surprisingly high tolerance for alcohol, owing to the heavy-drinking lifestyle of a ladder-climbing salaryman. Rock's earnest personality has earned him the interest of several figures in Roanapur, including Balalaika, Mr. Chang, Rowan ""Jackpot"" Pigeon, Yolanda, Eda (who develops a crush on him), and young Garcia Lovelace, whom he trusts to the greatest degree. In many ways, Rock is the heart of the Lagoon Company, serving as a balance for his more jaded teammates and as a bright spot in the world of darkness that is Roanapur. Dutch has stated that he believes Lagoon Company is complete with Rock not holding a gun, saying his bullets are the kind to ricochet back at them. 
  
 Rock is one of the ""luckiest"" characters in the series as he managed to survive every single thing he experienced from being taken hostage to being shot at. Thus far, he has survived the wrath of Revy, Balalaika, Roberta, and Sawyer. He is personally appointed by Mr. Chang to help Garcia Lovelace, much to Lagoon Company's disapproval. Rock eventually begins to enjoy his life as a pirate and becomes even more comfortable with corruption. Later, in a conversation with Fabiola, he demonstrates a darker, sadistically ruthless side of his personality clearly influenced by Revy and the Roanapur environment. Benny even points out that there are things about him that scare almost everyone in Roanapur. 
  
 While Rock has a family in Tokyo, he does not seem to have much connection to them due to their somewhat apathetic attitude towards him. It was later revealed that he did not pass his college entrance exams on his first try, leading his family to lower their expectations of him. It is known that he has a father, a mother, and an older brother who was academically capable and thus attained a job in the Japanese government. He was born in the 49th year of the Showa period, according to the manga version, which corresponds to 1975-1976.

 He is first in 10th grade for best grades. He is in love with Hikari, but she is too dense to notice it. Although he doesn't come straight out and admit it, it is common knowledge among the SA that he loves her, and Kei himself also doesn't deny it. The reason he hasn't confessed his love to her or asked her out is because he figured, knowing her, she'd probably just laugh it off (yes, for all her intellectual excellence, she is quite stupid/naive/innocent when it comes to love). 
  
 Although he is stoic most of the time and always keeps a calm facade under any circumstance, things involving Hikari are the only ones that bring out intense anxiety within him. It bothers him whenever Hikari pushes herself too hard, although it is for this very reason that he admires and respects her. 
  
 His birthday is on November 22nd.

1096,Tomie(富江),Itou Junji: CollectionItou Junji: Collection - TomieItou Junji: Maniac,1605,https://myanimelist.net/character/19174/Tomie,"Tomie enjoys the effect her beauty has on men, and seeks to seduce them, but feels no emotional attachment to any of her lovers. Once she no longer has an immediate use for a man, she'll discard him, a pattern that has led to several of her deaths. She's also jealous when attention is given to other women, and work to break up established couples if presented an opening. Extremely self-centered, she thinks nothing of manipulating others for her pleasure. 
  
 Little is known of Tomie's true background, not even her family name. It is not known how she gained her powers, or even if she was aware of them prior to 1986. According to witnesses, she aged normally to that point, and seemed a standard if very pretty and flirtatious girl. On a field trip to Inariyawa, a small mountain near her school, Tomie was pressuring a teacher she'd been having sex with to leave his wife and marry her, when a male classmate who'd become obsessed with Tomie accosted her. She taunted the boy, and in the ensuing scuffle, Tomie fell over a cliff. Believing Tomie dead, the teacher decided to cover up the accident by chopping up the girl's body with the aid of the boys of the class. It turned out she wasn't quite dead, so this became a particularly gruesome task. The class then scattered the body parts where they would, in theory, not be found. 
  
 Some parts were found, identified as Tomie's, and cremated. Her death was blamed on a psychopath, and a funeral was held. Which made it rather a shock when Tomie walked into class the next day as if nothing had happened. Her reappearance drove the more susceptible members of the class to madness, and when two of them tried to go to the police, the others turned violent in an attempt to stop them. Tomie disappeared shortly thereafter. 
  
 Tomie then began appearing in widely separated locations around Japan, inspiring men to passion and murder. She apparently died several more times, but always turned up alive again. Due to the police's stubborn refusal to credit these stories, no concerted effort was made to capture Tomie at least until 1995.

With her close friends and family she is a sweet, gentle, young woman with a great warmth and spirit. She tends to be independent, having been alone and taking care of herself for quite some time. Hotaru grew up very much alone, sick, and an outcast, shunned by her classmates who were frightened of her. It was not until she met Chibi-Usa that she at last had a true friend.

 Karen has mentioned on multiple occasions that she ""really really really loves"" Shinobu (大大大好き!), which makes Alice jealous sometimes. She gets along with everybody in her class, even to the point where they would give her lots of food if she ever forgot her lunch. It has been noted that Karen doesn't gain weight despite consuming lots of food. 
  
 She calls Aya ""Ayaya,"" because of a small misunderstanding when they first met.

1103,Roberta(ロベルタ),Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood TrailBlack Lagoon OmakeBlack Lagoon,1590,https://myanimelist.net/character/2762/Roberta,"Roberta is a maid who worked for four years at the Lovelace household in Colombia. Although her domestic skills, such as cleaning and cooking, were poor, she has developed a close friendship with the young scion of the Lovelace family, Garcia. Roberta was once known as Rosarita Cisneros, a former FARC guerrilla trained as an assassin in Cuba and an internationally wanted criminal. She earned the moniker ""Bloodhound of Florencia"" for her relentless drive to achieve her objectives. 
  
 In combat, Roberta is a truly fearsome opponent, having trained in a wide variety of martial, stealth, and weapon skills. Among the weapons she has used before were a sniper rifle, a combat knife, a shotgun disguised as an umbrella, a machine gun which was disguised as a briefcase, a grenade launcher, spiked brass knuckles, a trench spike, and pistols. Her strength, speed, endurance, and instincts were honed to almost supernatural levels. An example being Roberta chasing down Lagoon company's getaway car and holding on by driving her knife into the rear of the car, nearly pulling the muscular Dutch out from his car, and accurately fire a large caliber sniper rifle from the hip with one arm. 
  
 It is ironic that while Roberta is one of the most powerful warrior-women in the story of Black Lagoon, she is also humane, possessing warmth, kindness, remorse, and family love for her master and his son. 
  
 She admitted that she did murder children, women or anyone in name of revolution during her FARC years. Disillusioned by the fact that she is merely a tool for drug cartels in cahoots with FARC in the end, she opted out and joined the Lovelace clan as a maid. Despite being asked by Garcia not to pick up gunfighting anymore, later events of manga story make her go into battle again, seeking revenge. 
  
 She is also heavily modeled on El Mariachi, popularized by Antonio Banderas down to suitcase machine gun signature and her Latin America background.

 The protagonist of City Hunter. Ryou is a combat expert, having fought as a guerrilla in numerous conflicts alluded to throughout the series, and has a long history of working in the underground. He carries a Colt Python. His mysterious past starts with him being the only survivor of a plane crash in Central America as a toddler. The crash left him an orphan in a rebel village during a civil war, prompting him to learn to fight at a young age. As a result, he has very little information on his true parentage, or even his birthdate. (Later, Kaori Makimura unilaterally declared March 26 his birthday, as that was the day they first met). After the war he ended up in the United States, where he worked as a hired gun, but eventually he found his way to Tokyo, Japan. There he formed the ""City Hunter"" team with Hideyuki Makimura (Kaori's brother), and it's sometime after that where the manga/TV series' timeline begins. 
  
 One of Ryou's most striking traits as a character is his extreme sexual excitability. Especially in the manga, where, as Saeba himself often notes, he experiences an erection every time he sees or even thinks about something sexual. As a result of this, he constantly flirts with, tries to seduce, or even literally harasses most of the female characters he finds sexy. Even with those whom he knows and respects well, to the point of refusing to take orders from men unless their request touches something in his soul. And while he can always pull himself together and take things seriously when needed, various adaptations often downplay this trait of his to still exaggerated, but more tame dimensions.

She is accompanied by an elf, Evarella. She aided Guts's group with a troll infestation in the nearby village Enoch, where she showed how powerful magic can be in Berserk. 
  
 After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions. 
  
 Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense ""Od"" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts. 
  
 As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Their journey together constantly brings them into even deeper understanding.

It turns out that anyone can use Excalibur. However, no one can put up with its personality (it has a bigger ego than Black Star). The only reason that those who use it are called heroes is that they can put up with its annoying habits, such as a list of one-thousand things he demands to be completed, such as daily five-hour reading sessions. Excalibur was first introduced when Kid and Black Star found a book about him and thus sought him out, only to discover that the book had in fact been written by Excalibur himself. They quickly ditched him due to his personality. His other form is completely the opposite given his elegant weapon form, looking like a cartoon-ish gentlemen with an outrageous mustache and no pants. On the other hand, his legendary powers have been proven by a fellow Shibusen student who found completing the appointed tasks easy. Excalibur can grant great power, light speed, and teleportation, and the wielder can easily defeat three of Shibusen's strongest combined. In the end, Excalibur was put back again because the student could not put up with his annoying sneeze. His existence throughout the story is purely comical, with the exception of the fact of how he informed Kid, the Thompsons, Buttataki, and Blair about the story of Eibon, backed by Shinigami.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/524074.jpg

 Occupation: S-Class Mage, Fairy Tail Head Waitress 
  
 Mirajane is the cover girl or drawing point of Fairy Tail. She is 19 years old, an S-class mage, model to Sorcerer Magazine, and the older sister of Elfman and Lisanna. When Mirajane was an S-class mage, she was known as ""The Demon."" However, due to a past incident involving the death of her younger sister, Lisanna, Mirajane somehow lost much of her magical ability and her will to fight. Given the recent event of Elfman regaining his lost abilities and Mirajane's increased confidence, Mirajane may someday regain her abilities and move forward with her life. 
  
 Mirajane plays a motherly role within the guild, and is often seen running the bar at the guild hall. She has rarely been shown to be in a bad mood, and can tolerate all of the guild's eccentricities. However, there have been a couple incidents that have disturbed Mirajane, including her discovery of the stealing of an S-Class job by Natsu, Happy and Lucy, and her later disappointment with Laxus following the destruction of the guild building. When she was younger, she was also very bold, brash, and temperamental, more specifically to her comrade Erza. She was described as infamous amongst guilds and criminals alike. However, this changed after her younger sisters death. 
  
 Mirajane got her name from an online video game Hiro Mashima was playing while he created her.

He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D has surprising power and resourcefulness, possessing most of the strengths and only mild levels of vampiric weaknesses. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a ""normal"" human, though marked by his unearthly beauty and powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by humans. His only notable weaknesses are that he is, while not unfeeling, emotionally remote but sometimes sentimental. He is also (far more rarely than other dhampirs) randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years. Otherwise, D does not suffer from vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, possessing an imposing supernatural aura to his opponents and godlike reflexes surpassing even vampires.

 Oskar von Reuenthal is a rear admiral serving in Reinhard's fleet and, along with Wolfgang Mittermeyer, Reinhard's ablest field commander. 
  
 Reuenthal was born to a lowly, but rich noble father and a mother from a distinguished but impoverished line that only married his father for his material affluence. Reuenthal was born with a rare condition called heterochromia, one of his eyes is blue, while the other is brown. Since both his parents had blue eyes, this was seen as proof of his mother's adultery. His mother committed suicide after trying to pluck out his brown eye while he was still an infant. Reuenthal's father put the blame on him and he grew up hated and neglected. 
  
 Reuenthal joined the military and rose through the ranks rather quickly, finding in war the reason he needed to keep on living. While stationed in fortress Iserlohn, he met Wolfgang Mittermeyer and the two became close friends. Mittermeyer is probably the only person Reuenthal has managed to have a normal relationship with and he greatly values their friendship. When Mittermeyer was unjustly detained and in danger of assassination by the nobility, Reuenthal didn't hesitate to pledge his loyalty to Reinhard in return for his help with Mittermeyer's case. 
  
 Reuenthal appears calm and composed on the outside, he is a brilliant war strategist, second only to Reinhard, and an accomplished tactician, but Reuenthal is, in reality, a ticking bomb ready to go off at any moment and perhaps would have already exploded if not for Mittermeyer's soothing presence in his life. His problematic childhood has ridden him with an incredible amount of self-loathing and a complete inability to trust women, though handsome and successful with the opposite sex, he never manages to get into a healthy relationship. Proud and ambitious Reuenthal often contemplates treachery, but his respect towards Reinhard and the debt he owes him, manage to restrain him. His flagship is the Tristan.

 Sumireko Sanshokuin, sometimes called by her nickname Pansy (三色菫), is a main character in Oresuki. She is a second year High School student and a helper in the school library. 
  
 Pansy looks like an unattractive gloomy bookworm with long black hair tied in braids, thick glasses and a sharp tongue towards Joro. Beneath her unappealing exterior, she is in fact a gorgeous beauty with a bust size far larger than she typically shows. 
  
 Pansy presents herself as an authentic and common person yet an individual with strong charisma and observation. From her perspectives and experiences, she shows herself to be a well-mannered smooth-talker with good advice and a level head, as well as a lovable beauty queen. She appears as a strong person with powerful enthusiasm, but she does show fear at the thought of being with her stalkers. 
  
 She is polite to her peers at school, only turning a sharp tongue at Joro. After she makes friends with Himawari, Cosmos and Sun, she shows that she is very kind and considerate to people close to her. 
  
 Pansy was pushed into dating Hose in middle school, and she moved away to get away from him, as well as vowed to never keep her true feelings hidden and clash with them head-on once she’s become a high schooler (which trouble Joro the most). She sees that Joro is very similar to Hose and she aims to prevent him from becoming like Hose by giving him affection, as well as forcing him to face his shortcomings such as his inferiority complex.

 Zodiac sign: Leo 
  
 Smart, attractive, athletic and talented, Yukino Miyazawa appears to be the model student. Both her male and female peers express their admiration for her, often asking her for help and commenting about her model features and characteristics. However, her ""perfect"" exterior hides the fact that everything she does is done solely to receive praise from others. She has been this way since she was a little girl—a self-professed ""queen of vanity""—Yukino once practiced playing her recorder until she vomited blood. With all this praise, however, she never realized that she never had a real friend aside from her family and was considered by her peers as a kind of semi-approachable ""guest."" This all changes when Yukino meets Soichiro Arima, another model student who beats her high school entrance exam score, and is even more popular and athletic than Yukino. 
  
 Yukino is envious of her rival Soichiro, and works hard to top his grades. When Soichiro confesses that he has a crush on her, she rejects him and laughs about it afterwards. But her observant sister Kano points out that Yukino's rivalry with him is born of admiration. This revelation is useless, however, as Yukino accidentally lets her guard down and Soichiro discovers that she is a slob at home. Soichiro uses this to blackmail her to spend more time with her.

 The princess of the human kingdom. Kidnapped by the Demon King, she spends her days waiting for the heroes to rescue her. At least, that's how it was supposed to be... 
  
 Soon after being taken as a hostage, Suya makes the most out of her situation by pilfering different objects to make her life easier (at the expense of the demons' peace of mind). Initially acting quite selfishly, the longer her stay at the Demon Castle extends, the more Suya finds herself caring about its citizens and taking more interest in the political relations between the human and demon kingdoms. 
  
 Although others tend to see and treat her as a child, Suya is actually an adult. Despite her tendency to laze around, she is very meticulous, efficient and focused when it comes to doing her work as a royal princess, and it is implied that she seldom got time to rest while living in the human kingdom. As evidenced by the various objects she builds herself, Suya is also quite handy and resourceful.

 Abilities: Superhuman Speed, Agility 
 Weapons: Ninja equipment 
 Occupation: Bodyguard (former), Villain 
 Affiliation: Zeniru (former) 
  
 Sonic is a villain, first appearing as a bodyguard hired by Zeniru. He views Saitama as his eternal rival. 
  
 Sonic is a thin, slightly effeminate man, who despite his slender build is extremely strong and fast. He has black medium length hair that is tied up in a topknot. One noticeable feature is that he has two purple marks under his eyes, one under each. He first appears wearing a tight black outfit highlighted by metal plating on the shins, fore-arms, shoulders and chest, as well as a long purple scarf. He is shown later in black street clothes. He always carries a ninjato and other ninja equipment such as kunai and ninja stars. 
  
 Sonic is a villain who, despite his normally calm appearance, loves fighting strong opponents as shown by when he gets a ""child-like smile"" on his face when he first meets Saitama and has two of his attacks blocked, earlier calling this his ""bad habit."" He seems to be very quick to act as he attacks Saitama on their first meeting without letting him explain the situation. 
  
 After being defeated by Saitama for the first time (episode 4), while working as a bodyguard for Zeniru, he devotes his time into finding a way to defeat him.

 Height: 166 cm (5' 5"") 
 Weight: 56 kg (123 lbs) 
 BWH: 87/58/88 
 Rank: Low-class Devil 
 Role: Knight 
 Race: Reincarnated Devil (Former Human) 
 Weapon: Excalibur Destruction (Volume 3), Ascalon (shared with Issei), Ex-Durandal 
  
 Xenovia first appears in Volume 3 along with Irina under the order of the Church to retrieve the three stolen Excalibur swords. She and Irina formed a temporary alliance with Issei, Koneko, Yuuto, and Saji, in which they would retrieve the stolen Excaliburs fragments but would allow Yuuto to destroy one of them. During the fight with Freed Sellzen and Valper Galilei, she reveals herself to be the wielder of Durandal, and quickly turns the tide of battle by destroying the fused Excalibur and cutting down Freed. Following the battle with the Fallen Angel leader Kokabiel, she became a Devil under Rias after finding out that God died. 
  
 When Xenovia was first introduced, she was portrayed as an individual with a quiet and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She also prefers not to get involved in problems that do not concern her. While a faithful member of the Church, her beliefs are flexible enough to accept help from a Dragon such as receiving a free lunch (after Irina spent all their money on a fake painting of a Saint), and wanting to not only accomplish their mission, but survive afterwards as well. After Volume 3, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they previously met. Like Asia, as a person who was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school. 
  
 As a Knight, Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds, which, combined with the destructive powers of Durandal, makes her a formidable fighter. She also has the ability to tap into Durandal's holy aura with other swords, evident when she uses it with Issei's Ascalon (Issei allows her to use it since he is not a good swordsman and because she cannot fully control Durandal).",,,,"166 cm (5' 5"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/279781.jpg

 Mayumi is a young lady who is known for her natural beauty.

Her limbs are described as quite long despite her short stature, and her chest is also large in proportion to her height.

 Excluding her height, Mayumi is described as someone with a well-rounded personality and a feminine side. While it is hard to notice, she cares about others in her own unique way, so she fits the bill of being an ""older sister"" perfectly. She is generally quite confident in her appearance when in the presence of others.

However when he refused, she found out he would not leave until Kokonotsu was guaranteed to take his place as head of the store. She was horrified when she discovered Kokonotsu's natural talent would go to waste so she struck a bargain with his father: if she could convince Kokonotsu to become the head of the store, then his father would immediately join her father's company.

  From : Yugakure, the Village Hidden in the Steam 
  Weapon : 3-headed Scythe 
  Partner : Kakuzu 
  Religion : Jashin-ism 
  
 Because he is a member of the Jashin religion, Hidan has immortality. This immortality will end, however, if he does not regularly sacrifice people to Jashin. This is a religion that worships a deity of the same name and where anything less than death and utter destruction is considered a sin. His religion's experiments have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent's blood and then drawing Jashin's triangular-design on the ground, Hidan can create a voodoo doll-like link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan's body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Because he is immortal, Hidan is not impaired while doing this, instead finding pleasure in the pain it causes him. 
  
 Hidan is sadistic, arrogant, rude, and impatient. All qualities which his partner, Kakuzu, finds annoying. He and his partner, Kakuzu, fight and argue constantly, so it might be a wonder why they are put on the same team.  Kakuzu actually commented that he and Hidan made the perfect team, because even thought Kakuzu has the urge to kill Hidan often, he is unable to due to his partner's immortality. Because Kakuzu is considered immortal as well, their own fellow Akatsuki member, Kisame Hoshigake, jokingly referred to the team as the ""Zombi Combi"".  Hidan likes to annoy the other members of the Akatsuki, and even refers to them by insulting nicknames, such as ""Dei-chan"". He dislikes Pain's authority over him and openly challenges him in front of others. Hidan's aggressiveness is the reason he left his village, where he was frustrated by the peace and lack of violence, before leaving he slaughtered many of his neighbours in cold-blood for entertainment.",,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/2792/Hidan: 'src'

She is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Neptune in the final episode of Sailor Moon R. When transformed, she is known as Sailor Uranus, and is part of the group known in Fanon as the Outer Senshi. 
  
 Haruka is a race car driver, even though she is barely sixteen years old when she appears. However, the timing of her birthday to the Japanese school year means she is one grade ahead of the Inner Senshi.

1160,"Miyamori, Aoi(宮森 あおい)",ShirobakoShirobako Movie,1483,https://myanimelist.net/character/111907/Aoi_Miyamori,"In her school days, she was interested in animation, so she joined a club. Along with her four friends, they created an animation titled ""Shinbutsu Konkou Shichifukujin,"" which was to be shown at their high school's cultural festival. During production, everyone played their roles in order to complete the project. However, it is revealed that Aoi is not the greatest at drawing, computer graphics, script writing, or voice acting. Before graduation, the girls made a promise to reunite one day and create another anime altogether. They set this creed in stone by sharing donuts. It seems that everyone has their minds set on what they want to pursue in the anime industry. As for Aoi, she graduated without a specific goal in mind, and came to Musashino Animation to work as a production assistant, immediately getting involved in her first anime, Exodus! 
  
 After her first year as a production assistant at Musashino Animation, the company is hired to work on an anime adaptation for a manga titled ""The Third Girl Aerials Squad."" At this time, Aoi is promoted by director Seiichi Kinoshita to her new position as Head Production Assistant after her colleague, Yutaka Honda, resigned from the company to pursue his dreams. This deals a great amount of pressure on Aoi, as she is immediately overwhelmed by the tasks involved in her position. 
  
 Aoi seems to have a bright and cheerful personality and she always strives to stay positive, no matter how murky the problem. She is also hardworking and cares a lot for her friends and always tries to stay calm in stressful situations, and she is also a very energetic girl. 
  
 Although a fresh face at Musashino Animation, she quickly learns how to cope with the everyday stresses of her job. Her diligence and determination to find a solution to every predicament has garnered the respect of many of her colleagues and acquaintances in the industry, alike. She is very persistent and patient when caught in between predicaments at work.

 Rin appears to be a tomboy due to playing sports and not wearing a skirt when she was a child. She mostly teases Koizumi Hanayo and appears to be with her most of the time. Her personality is similar to Kousaka Honoka's because they're both determined and hard-working. She usually ends her sentences with nyan~! (Meow). In addition, she sometimes acts like a cat and does the signature curved mouth look. Despite acting like a cat, Rin is, ironically, allergic to cats. Hanayo and Rin once found a stray cat but could not adopt it due to Rin's allergies. 
  
 Rin is great at sports, and is skilled in hurdling, football, and basketball. She enjoys dance very much and is the current practice leader of μ's. Her special skill is her sharp nose, which is almost on par with a dog's.

 Specialties: Pitching, mental calculations 
 Techniques: Iga's ""Kira"" (伊賀「気羅」) 
  
 A 16-year-old ninja in the Kairōshū who uses the forbidden technique ""kira"". This technique shoots the user's ki into the body of a target and controls it from the inside out, which can cause the target's bones to break or their body to completely explode. The cost of using this technique is the loss of the user's life force, gradually losing their five senses and eventually dying. According to volume 4, he has roughly two more months to live. He appears to be very sensitive, as he used the kira technique and almost killed a delivery man just because he called him a ""cute kid"". He is also shown to eat at a rapid pace. After first abducting Miharu and taking him to an abandoned train car, Yoite tells Miharu his friends will die from the ki he implanted inside them; unless Miharu utilizes the Shinrabanshō to grant his wish, to be ""erased"" from existence. This turns out to be a lie, but Miharu still aims to grant the wish.

Friend of Akihisa from 1st year. 
  
 Hideyoshi is one of the rare people with normal minds in Class F, but because of that he is often pressured by his classmates. According to his grandpa, Hideyoshi is an owner of an unbelievable beauty, so much that he is often called a girl―but really, he is a fine man. His loveliness even nominated him in the list of 'Guys who would look good in girl's outfit', sponsored by the Journalism club, but he was eventually dropped from the ranking for being 'unfair'. Because of his appearance, girls often forget his real gender, leaving Akihisa as the only one who recognizes him as a guy (though sometimes even Akihisa forgets this). In training camps, for the safety of his own and the others, he is given a private separate dressing room and bathroom. In school, there is a rumor that Hideyoshi is actually of the 3rd gender, dubbed ""Hideyoshi"". As with Akihisa's case, Hideyoshi's photos are secretly sold and bought―the price of his photo being 5 times higher than photos of Akihisa in girl outfits. He feels regretful for not being treated as a guy by many. However, given that he blushes his face when treated as a girl by Akihisa, delights when called a fool's friend, puts in tackles that are subtly off the point―it seems he doesn't hate it so much either. Therefore, this person is also not exactly normal. 
  
 He takes part in the Drama club and his speciality is vocal mimicry―be that a girl's or a boy's voice. Even though he is often not too willing to act, once a situation occurs, he perfectly deals with his given role, thanks to his excessive drama spirit. Part of the reason why he is in Class F is because he too absorbed into drama and couldn't keep up the grades. It seems he is especially weak in Classic Literature. 
  
 In contrast to his lovely outlook, he has an extremely strong stomach ('Steel Stomach' as called by himself) that can even take in a potato seed. However, even such stomach cannot stand against Mizuki's mighty lunch. 
  
 His name originates from 'Toyotomi Hideyoshi' and his old name 'Kinoshita Toukichirou'. 
  
 His shoukanjuu (summoned beast)'s equipments are blue pants and Naginata. Occult version is Nekomata (ghost cat girl), obviously influenced from the nature 'Cuteness'. 
  
 Hideyoshi is ranked 1st in Male Characters and 10th in Female Characters of the 2009 version of ""Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! (このライトノベルがすごい!)"", scoring a cumulative 2nd place from all characters.

Katsu no wa Ore da,1437,https://myanimelist.net/character/2707/Trunks,"Trunks is the Human and Saiyan hybrid son of Bulma and Vegeta, and later the older brother of Bulla. 
  
 As a child during the Majin Buu arc, Trunks is shown to be quite cocky and stingy just like his father, as well as mischievous, most likely due to the fact that this Trunks grew up with his father Vegeta and enjoyed the luxuries of peace, while Future Trunks grew up without Future Vegeta and in an apocalyptic world, causing him to be much more serious and cautious. Trunks has a combination of both of his parents' personalities: cocky and proud like his father and spoiled and selfish like his mother. 
  
 In his later years, Trunks adopts a personality similar to his future counterpart's. During and in between his battles at the World Martial Arts Tournament, he acts just like his father does, calm when he fights and insulting his opponents.

Megami-sama!: Chichaitte Koto wa Benri da ne,1429,https://myanimelist.net/character/756/Belldandy,"Belldandy is unflinchingly kind, patient, and warm, not only to Keiichi but to everyone, without exception. However, this does not mean that she is to be taken lightly; Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. The only time at which she has ever revealed her true strength is during the Lord of Terror arc. At the end of this arc, Belldandy completely reconstructed their home from rubble, mentioning that doing so only took one ten-millionth of her power. 
  
 Belldandy's capacities and talents are diverse, whether magical or worldly. Not only can she change the appearance of her clothing and levitate (and, by extension, fly) as all full-fledged goddesses are expected to, but she can also teleport through mirrors, speak to and understand animals, ""see"" people's emotions as auras, heal minor wounds by speeding metabolism, and ""speak"" to machines. Furthermore, she is a superb cook, and her singing skills are held to be the best in the heavens. She is also incapable of getting drunk on alcoholic drinks, but instead gets drunk with soda (it has to be noted, however, that she's a complete lightweight in this regard. One sip is enough to send her in a drunken rampage—although given her personality, ""rampage"" takes an entirely different, but no less destructive, meaning). In addition, she is also the top broom racer in heaven, the only one that could rival her is Welsper from hell or Hild the Daimakaichou herself. 
  
 Belldandy's angel is Holy Bell (Bless餠Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus (in the movie), Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus. 
  
 Belldandy does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining Yggdrasil. Rather, she works at the Goddess Relief Agency which deals with granting wishes (forming contracts) with humans, similar to Peorth's work at the Earth Assistance Agency.

 Amu Hinamori, the series protagonist, is a student of Seiyo Elementary. Amu's classmates see her as a ""Cool and Spicy"" girl, but Amu is actually extremely shy and timid. Part of the reason for this misunderstanding is the trendy punk clothing her mother buys for her as well as the way in which she expresses her shyness and avoids doing new things.

 He lost his memory during a brain washing program. At first he thinks he is a terrorist. He met Saki in Washington D.C., being naked and only carrying a gun and a cellphone.

He has a very modern cell phone with the phrase ""noblesse oblige"" printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit. When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be Juiz answers. After she sent him a map with the place where he was supposed to go he finds, in his apartment, guns and many different passports which seemed to all belong to him (after his arrival in Japan, Juiz told him that he has to use up all his digital money). Then he met the girl named Saki and they return to Japan together. According to his passport, he lives in Japan, Toyosu, his name is Akira Takizawa and he was born on January 7, 1989 and since the series takes place in 2010 he is, therefore, 21 years old.

 Likes: likes sweet things 
 Love interest: Miyano Yoshikazu 
 Sexuality: Not confirmed, has a preference for both genders. 
  
 Initially, Sasaki is introduced as a bright and cheerful, if overly eager, upperclassman; however, this is not necessarily the whole picture. He can be rash and impulsive, acting or speaking without thinking of the consequences or the people around him. Though he does have some friends, Sasaki is something of a loner. In flashbacks, with his family, or when he is alone he is usually shown to be gloomy and quiet, often repeating the phrase ""it's annoying."" 
  
 Sasaki Shuumei is one of the two eponymous main characters of Sasaki and Miyano. While he has a reputation as a bad boy, he is very affectionate toward Miyano Yoshikazu and enjoys spending time with him. He is dating Miyano Yoshikazu.

 Sango is youkai slayer (""youkai taijiya"") who hails from a village of professional yōkai slayers. The only member of Inuyasha's group to have no supernatural powers, Sango instead wields the Hiraikotsu, a massive boomerang made of yōkai bones, in addition to a broad repertoire of tools and tricks for battling yōkai. Sango is also a victim of Naraku's evil schemes; her family was killed and her entire village destroyed by Naraku's yōkai so that Naraku could then blame Inuyasha and manipulate Sango into trying to kill him. When that ploy failed, Naraku used a shard of the Shikon Jewel to revive and control her little brother Kohaku, forcing him to fight Inuyasha and company, and using him as a means by which to manipulate Sango. She seeks vengeance against Naraku, but her primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku's influence and somehow save his life, although currently it's uncertain if she will be able to do so as Kohaku's life is tied to the jewel shard. She has obvious feelings towards Miroku, although she is offended by his constant groping and lechery. (""Sango"" means ""coral"")

 Zodiac sign: Aries 
 Height: 174 cm (5'8½"") 
 Weight: 54kg (119 lbs) 
 Occupation: 12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute 
  
 Mayuri Kurotsuchi is Captain of the 12th Division in the Gotei 13 and 2nd president of the Shinigami Research Institute. He gained his position after Kisuke Urahara, the former captain and president, was sentenced into exile by Soul Society. His lieutenant is Nemu Kurotsuchi, his artificially-created ""daughter."" 
  
 Mayuri's appearance has a very skeletal look to it with a skull-like visage. His fingernails are blue and, with the exception of the fingernail on his right middle finger, are all short. The one long fingernail is as long as the finger itself. In the anime, Mayuri is revealed to have blue hair and yellow eyes when unmasked. He also wears a white hat with two ends that point to his right and a large purple scarf around his neck. He repaints his make-up every morning, as he always removes it before going to bed. 
  
 Mayuri's left arm can extend out like a grappling hook. Mayuri is able to pull out part of his ear, which is Scythe like weapon attached to his body. He is able to blend himself with the environment with some sort of covering that flakes away once he reveals himself. 
  
 Mayuri Kurotsuchi is a researcher and personifies the stereotype of the mad scientist. By his early actions during the Ryoka Invasion, he is displayed as one of the most sadistic and cruel Shinigami. He sees everyone and everything not as a living being, but as an object to be researched—including himself. He has little respect or regard for most others, and was even willing to turn his own men (who were not aware of his plans) into human bombs in an attempt to capture Uryū Ishida and Orihime Inoue for experimentation. He also withheld vital information about the Bount from the other Shinigami in order to capture one as a research subject for himself. 
  
 It is known that Mayuri's favorite food is pike fish, while he does not like onion. One of his free-time activities is reading every character published in Seiretei Communication. He himself publishes a serialization in the journal, titled ""Effective Medication for the Brain,"" which apparently contains detailed instructions on preparation of medicine and their application. Surprisingly it is highly popular among the readers. 
  
 In battle Mayuri likes to play with his opponent torturing little by little until they can hardly stand.",,,,"174 cm (5'8½"")","12th Division Captain, Vice-President of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/11/73295.jpg

 After being bullied for his unusual name at a young age, Nasa Yuzaki wanted people to respect his name, rather than laugh at its uniqueness. He decided that in order to make that happen, he felt he needed to study harder than anyone else. Through this, he somewhat achieves his goal. 
  
 He marries Tsukasa after she saves his life in chapter 1. Although he is shown to be somewhat pervy, he is a very good partner to Tsukasa. 
  
 Nasa is an extremely organized person. He states a few times that ""even if [his] house were to burn down, it would be okay"", as all of his possessions are either digital or replaceable.

He is a cocky, ambitious warlord who tends to speak in a mixture of English and Japanese. He usually wields a single katana, but can store and fight with six swords at once (three in each hand, held between the fingers). He is also depicted in a rivalry with Sanada Yukimura. 
  
 (Source: Wikipedia) 
  
 Off the battlefield, Date's demeanor is surprisingly quiet, mild and thoughtful. He discusses plans and difficulties openly with his men and often weighs the counsel of his second in command, Kojuurou Katakura, before making major decisions. This inner personality contrast adds to his character's appeal. Also, his loyalty to his men is unmistakable.

Both have done terrible things to one another, the most notable in the Hetalia series (on England's part) being when England's army burned Jeanne d'Arc at the stake. A teenage France used to pick on a young England back in the day, but their little squabbles and arguments (even in present times) are usually and have been over extremely petty issues. Despite this, they seem to have an underlying respect for one another and spend every Christmas together as shown in the comics. England also allowed France to 'conquer him when they thought the world was ending, something which France had always dreamed of. They are also shown to be quite close to each other, even if they do bicker often, France being one of the Englishman's closest friends (even if he'll deny it.) 
  
 He raised America as a child after fighting over him with France and Finland. The two were like brothers, but England insisted that America not refer to him as such (the unpleasant memories of his own brothers haunted him). Due to America declaring his independence and fighting against him, their relationship was spoiled. Apparently, on every 4th of July (America's Independence Day) since then, he becomes ill and heartbroken. In present times, the two are always butting heads over something, but deep down, they both care for each other. 
  
 Although America was like a brother to him, he does have actual blood brothers; Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who have yet to be profiled, were mentioned to hate his guts, going so far as to throw rocks at him, mail curses to him, and shoot arrows at him to keep him away from them. His youngest brother is Sealand, who also seems to hate him, calling him ""Jerk England."" Even so, England does care for him (though is usually annoyed and frustrated with him and his antics). 
  
 His personality is rather cynical, stubborn, sarcastic, competitive, and cold, even though he claims to be a gentleman. He has a sharp tongue and a potty mouth, but is not a bad person. He's also described as being a tsundere. When he becomes friends with someone, he is surprisingly very loyal to them. France noted him once as having a slender build. England has a strong belief in the supernatural and the occult; he can even perform black magic, see supernatural creatures, and is able to converse with said creatures (such as unicorns, ghosts, fairies, and even on some accounts, a flying bunny and Captain Hook). However, he refuses to believe in aliens. His hobbies include embroidery and other craftsmanship, drinking tea, getting drunk, literature, rock/punk music, and criticizing America's movies. He also loves to cook, but a running gag throughout the entire series is that he sucks at it and that his food has no taste whatsoever (which is why America, who grew up eating his food, is able to eat the strange ""delicacies"" that he does). When drunk, he becomes violent and bitter, often complaining or raving on about America in his drunken state. 
  
 His most noticeable feature are his thick, bushy eyebrows. During his pirate days, he used to set up colonies everywhere (and torment the heck out of Spain). It appears as though all of his colonies (that have been personified so far) possess the same bushy eyebrows (examples being Hong Kong, Wy, and Australia). 
  
 Although he officially represents the United Kingdom as a whole, among his brothers Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, he is supposed to represent England. Through the Hetalia series, he's also referred to as ""England"" on numerous accounts (even though Hidekaz Himaruya stated that to the other countries of the world, he is simply ""United Kingdom""), which most of the general fandom is familiar with. The English dubbed version of the anime adaptation refers to him as ""Britain,"" something that, according to the company, was a request from the original Japanese producers.

 Height: at least 180 cm (5""11) 
 Birthday: March 21 
  
 Wakana is quite tall for his age, standing at least 180 centimeters. When Marin asked him his height, he was interrupted before he could finish saying, meaning that he may be taller than 180cm. He has short, black hair and gray eyes, along with a tiny mole on the outer lower corner of his right eye. 
  
 Outside of his school uniform, he is always wearing a samue, a general work outfit consisting of a blue suit jacket and pants, with a simple white shirt underneath. He wears wooden sandals and wears a white headband while working. He tends to have it over his shoulders when not wearing his headband. 
  
 At the start of the series, Wakana was a withdrawn person in high school, having no friends and a secret love and admiration for hina dolls.His solitary attitude makes him rather submissive with others. Wakana is rather shy and modest, not doing well with embarrassing or lewd topics. Wakana doesn't appear to have much of a life outside of his grandfather's store and helping Marin, as he always wears his work attire outside of his school uniform, and often spends his free time either sewing or painting hina doll faces.

 Like many others in Nazarick, Narberal views humans as low-class creatures. The only human exempt from her contempt is the lastborn of Pleiades. Though she does not particularly enjoy killing humans, she will not hesitate to do so if there's no reason to let them live. This nature makes her one of the two, along with Solution Epsilon, ""extremely dangerous"" Pleiades. 
  
 As a created NPC of Nazarick, she is extremely loyal to Momonga and proud of her quest to support him close by. Nevertheless, she does not understand Momonga's purpose to become a hero very well, so she does not hide her aggressive attitude towards humans and often refers to Momonga's alias Ainz with ""-sama,"" even when the two masquerade as adventurers. 
  
 In the web novel version, Narberal is also a doppelganger, though she used illusion magic to become the adventurer named Momon. Also in that version, she was created by Nishikienrai.

 Birthday: 29 November (The Castle of Cagliostro) 
 Height: 178 cm 
 Weight: 70 kg 
  
 He is a smooth gunman who is most seen accompanying Lupin in his endeavors and heists. Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman. 
  
 He can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a PTRS anti-tank rifle. Daisuke is also a skilled driver and pilot. 
  
 In the original manga series, Jigen is not always at Lupin's side but lurking in the background until needed. The anime series, however, shows Jigen as extremely loyal to Lupin and willing to partner up anytime for a given heist. 
  
 Jigen is noted for his quick temper; enemy and friend alike have been victim to his need to repay violence for insult. Both Lupin and Goemon have been on the receiving end of his blows in his response to their frank or comical criticism. 
  
 Despite Jigen's gruff facade, he has an ironic sense of humor and genuinely enjoys participating in each caper with his partners. He is, by far, the more pragmatic of the group, with a cynical streak founded in failed romances (his luck with women runs from bad to worse, with love interests often betraying him or dying). He is always distrustful of Fujiko Mine and becomes irritated when Lupin goes along with one of her plans. Among Lupin's group, Jigen is the least apprehensive at taking human life. While he considers killing women and children taboo, he is willing to put down any age or gender who offers a life threat, such as Linda in Part 2 Episode 26. 
  
 Where Lupin and Goemon Ishikawa XIII both have unique sartorial tastes, Jigen is pure basics. His typical wardrobe is a dark grey, dark green or black business suit, along with a white or light blue colored dress shirt, a black tie, and his ever-present dark grey or black broad-brimmed fedora; the hat ranks as his most prized possession outside of his weaponry. During the third anime series, Jigen's outfit is more light colored and his hatband has a cross-hatched or grid pattern design (similar to the original manga interpretation of the character); however the black look is most applied for OVA productions and TV specials. Jigen's thick hair is typically collar-length and unevenly cut. His chin curtain beard varies from an inch to three inches long and is also unruly. A few episodes of the anime use an occasional gimmick where the character has his hat pulled forward so that only the lower half of his face is visible or, if he's without his hat, his hair will be covering his upper face and eyes. However such episodes are rare; and Jigen's face is plainly shown with or without his hat in most animated depictions. 
  
 Jigen is the ""big brother"" of the group, and often serves as the voice of reason to Lupin's impulsiveness, as he must because of his friendship with Lupin as well as out of sheer professionalism. However, he has long since resigned himself to having to go along with the craziest of schemes. Jigen, like the rest of the Lupin gang, is adept with disguises and can pilot virtually any motorized vehicle, including planes and tanks. He has even controlled a NASA Space Shuttle. He is also a tough hand-to-hand opponent, capable of knocking out an attacker with one blow. 
  
 While his racial origins may be in question, Jigen was at one time a famed bodyguard and assassin for many American criminal mobs. Of several stories regarding his past, the most popular has him an American mobster who moved to Japan on the lam; there he adopted a Japanese identity and name (""Jigen"" is the conventional Japanese word for ""dimension"", not a name). According to Lupin, Jigen's hobbies are limited due to his stay-at-home preference. When he does go out, he usually attends target practice, visits a favorite bar, plays poker, enjoys a boxing match or eats at a chop house-style restaurant. He also has a weakness for Spaghetti Westerns, lounging, classical music (except in Episodes 79 and 89 of Part 2), and hearty American food. 
  
 Jigen's most obvious pastime is smoking; there is hardly a time when he not seen with a cigarette, usually one bent in a number of directions. His preferred brands have been Pall Mall Filter Longs or Marlboro Red. He is also seen occasionally smoking a briar pipe. As well, Jigen enjoys drinking scotch, bourbon, vodka, beer and occasionally fine wines; he has a ""heavyweight's"" resistance to intoxication. 
  
 The Tokyo Pop releases of the original Lupin manga note in their preface that Jigen's appearance and temperament are based on the actor James Coburn, especially Coburn's role, Britt, in The Magnificent Seven. This has been confirmed by Monkey Punch during a 2003 Dallas, Texas anime convention interview. In a television documentary celebrating the manga's history, Monkey Punch stated he based the Jigen/Lupin relationship on Alain Delon and Charles Bronson's teaming in the 1968 film Adieu l'ami.

 Birthday: October 18 
  
 Kodaka's younger sister; she is a student in middle school, but nonetheless joins the club. She is very close to her brother, who she calls ""An-Chan"", and behaves in a jealous and clingy way whenever she feels that he is not giving her the attention she deserves, to the point where it is obvious that she has a brother complex. She sees Maria as a rival for Kodaka's brotherly affections, so she often gets into fights with her. 
  
 She has a penchant for darkness, vampires and the macabre ever since she started watching an anime called Full Metal Necromancer. As a result she often speaks in an affected fashion, and claims to be known as ""Reisys VI Felicity Sumeragi"", an ancient vampire who has lived for ten thousand years, but this façade quickly breaks down when she gets emotionally worked up and she speaks in a strong Kyūshū accent. Indeed, her behavior does not for the most part differ from that of a regular girl (procrastinating with her homework, staying inside when it is hot, etc.) which Kodaka points out, causing her to be embarrassed and slightly lose character.

1226,Canti(カンチ),FLCLFLCL Progressive,1374,https://myanimelist.net/character/633/Canti,"Canti is a medical robot with what looks like a television set for a head. He was manufactured by Medical Mechanica, but taken over by Atomsk as a way to escape MM. After having his head broken by Haruko he is recruited by her as an assistant, however he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family. It is later revealed that Atomsk can manifest through him, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk's symbol appears on Canti's screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for ""adult"" (大人). This symbol also appears on him when Naota ""swings the bat"" in Full Swing. When Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax, a similar symbol appears, but he uses the kanji for ""child"" (小人). 
  
 The emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason- shame. He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him. 
  
 Canti also dons a halo and fake wings (which Haruko was wearing in early episode two). Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him Lord Canti after ""The God of Black Flames"" in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series. Apparently, he can also eat curry with his ""mouth,"" but it is never really explained how.

 Birthday: February 5 
 Blood type: B 
 Genetic type: Coordinator 
 Height: 158 cm, 162 cm (GSmovie) 
  
 Lacus Clyne is a pop idol among the PLANTs, owing to both the influence of her father Siegel Clyne, Supreme Council chairmen of PLANT, and her beautiful singing voice (which many suspect may have developed due to her being a Coordinator). Near the beginning of the series she was engaged to Athrun Zala through an arranged marriage. Though (according to the drama CD) the two were in love when they first met, their feelings diminished as time went on and the engagement became more political then ever before. 
  
 The pink-haired princess enters the series when she is traveling in a civilian vessel for a memorial ceremony on Junius Seven. The ship is mistaken for a ZAFT military aircraft, and is attacked by the Earth Alliance. Lacus is escorted to a lifepod, and escapes safely. Shortly thereafter, Lacus' escape pod is discovered by Kira in the Strike. He brings the pod back to the Archangel. 
  
 The doors to the life pod open and out hops a small, pink, robotic ball. Following after it is Lacus Clyne herself in a bit of dismay that she was saved by Earth forces. Despite being enemies, the girl is cheery and kind to everyone on the ship as they keep her hostage. ZAFT forces discover the Archangel, and a battle breaks out. Before the Earth Alliance can suffer more loss, Natarle Badgiruel opens a channel to the enemy. It is then revealed to ZAFT that Lacus Clyne, the famous idol, is onboard the Archangel. 
  
 Kira is distraught and, due to Flay's abusive words, comes direly close to an emotional breakdown; however, Lacus attempts to comfort him. The couple find that they both know Athrun Zala on a personal level, and even that Athrun made Lacus' Haro/Pink-chan (her pink, robotic ball) and Kira's Torii (his flying bird robot). Kira decides to return Lacus to where she belongs with Athrun. 
  
 Even before meeting Kira, Lacus had an indirect influence on the war. She spread her opinion throughout PLANT by singing a song of peace, her lyrics filled with the hope of harmony between the nations. After encountering the Archangel, she expresses a larger need to achieve peace by aiding Kira many more times, causing Athrun to question his purpose for taking part in the war, and much more.","16, 18 (GSD), 20 (GSFreedom)",,,"158 cm, 162 cm (GSmovie)",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/122415.jpg

Unlike all the citizens of the village, she can leave any time she wants and go wherever she pleases. 
  
 Although being beloved by the Narehate of the village, she is often irritated or angry according to Majikajya, and she seems to greatly dislike being observed. The Narehate in Ilblu freak her out a bit, especially the ones with lots of eyes. 
  
 She speaks in a simplistic and primitive manner, referring to herself in third person, and communicating only with short sentences that are sometimes hard to understand.

 Marika transfers to Raku's class and is introduced as his fiancée; she bears a key that she thinks will unlock Raku's pendant, and is the most vocal about expressing her love to Raku. She is the daughter of the police chief, and has been in love with Raku for the past ten years. She does not get along with Chitoge; she states she hates girls with long hair despite the fact that she also has long hair. She has a frail constitution; ten years prior, she was frequently visited by a young Raku, who brought her gifts and sparked a friendship with her. She used to speak in a rather vulgar manner but has attempted to correct her language after Raku had told her that he likes girly girls with long hair. However, when flustered, she reverts to her old speaking habits.

Before he can arrive at the theater of war he is betrayed by a former comrade, Floki, who hires Askeladd to assassinate him. Thors is largely considered the greatest fighter to appear in the series, having defeated the likes of Askeladd and Thorkell in single combat. Such was his strength that Floki was unwilling to engage him directly, even with an entire squadron of Jomsviking warriors. Unlike his son, Thors has no explicit or implied historical basis.

 Eri is shown to be a perfect role model to the students in Otonokizaka High School. With her as the student council president, she is often portrayed as a cold and strict character due to her responsibilities, and being against the idea of Kousaka Honoka and her friends forming an idol group to get more attention from the public. 
  
 Eri is highly respected and well-known among the students, especially among her juniors. Unlike Nozomi, she appears rather stoic and skeptical in the early episodes, but it is shown that Eri is actually very kind and caring towards people that are close to her, like her little sister. On top of that, she is also very mature and level-headed and acts as a strategist in promoting their group.

 Ohana Matsumae is the main character of the story. She is an energetic and mostly optimistic 16-year-old high school girl. She was born in Tokyo, but is sent to live at her grandmother's inn, Kissuisou, when her mother elopes with her boyfriend to avoid debt. At her grandmother's request, she works at the inn as compensation for her residency. Before she leaves, her best friend, Kouichi Tanemura, confesses to her. However, he runs off before she can answer him. Ohana now feels awkward whenever she thinks about him. 
  
 She has many ideals and a strong sense of justice which often clash with people working at the inn; including her grandmother. Her desire to help others usually backfires or goes unappreciated. As a result of her mother's poor parenting, she became independent at a young age and grew up with the mentality of relying on herself only. However, since working at Kissuisou, she has realized how tough it is to go through life alone and begins to rely on others. She goes to the same high school as Minko, Nako, and Yuina.",16,,,147 cm,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/6/132503.jpg

 A snake familiar at the Yonomori shrine. Nanami saved his life from her cruel classmates by releasing him out a window, he fell in love with her, so he left an engagement mark on her wrist. After a day, he arrives at her school and whisks her away to the shrine, which she is unable to escape from. 
  
 Unlike other snakes, he was apparently raised in a greenhouse and has little knowledge of how most snakes behave. Mizuki is also very lonely because his god has vanished; she once existed when people visited the shrine and believed in her, but now no one lives in the valley and she has dwindled away to nothing. However, he still believes that she exists and will return. As a result, he wants Nanami to live with him forever at his shrine, but when she refuses he tries to rape her and is interrupted by Tomoe. 
  
 It is revealed that the shrine is an illusion meant to hide his god's favorite plum tree, which Mizuki treasured. Nanami promised to come look at the blossoms with him whenever he felt lonely. Like Kurama he seems to still be harboring a crush on Nanami, and even comes to cook for her when she's ill.",,,,"175 cm (5'9"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/16/194005.jpg

 Nicknamed the ""Ghost Princess"", Perona is a girl dressed in Gothic Lolita style and a commander in the army of Gecko Moria on his island-ship of Thriller Bark. She is also the commander of Perona Wonder Garden, where an army of animal zombies live and protect her. She looted the Thousand Sunny with some zombies and later took on guard duty while Absalom was away attempting to marry Nami. She cannot stand anything that she feels is not cute, such as insects. 
  
 Perona has eaten the Horo Horo no mi (Ghost Ghost fruit) which allows her to create several ghostly apparitions. The ghosts can pass through someone to cause them to go into a sort of induced depression. 
  
 Trivia 
  
 Like many other characters in One Piece, Perona has a unique laugh (horohorohoro, which contains the word horo, meaning ghost. It is also the name of her devil fruit). 
  
 Perona's dream is to have her own country made up of cute zombie animals with her as their leader. 
  
 Perona had no knowledge of Brook nor about the incident that occurred five years ago when he first appeared because she slept through the entire incident, scolding Kumashi when he tried to alert her. 
  
 Many members of Thriller Bark seem to be based on old Horror movie character types; Perona is based off of ghosts.

 He despises all forms of magic, believing its overuse can lead to one's downfall.

 Natsume is a extremely intelligent, to the point of being considered a genius, and despite this, ditches class frequently. Hated and feared by a lot of students at the academy because of his dangerous Alice and cold attitude. Due to the isolation he feels from most of his classmates and hatred many student feel about him he is often bullied even though he comes to ignore it, although the class he is a part of holds him in very high regard and often follows his orders. 
  
 He is thoroughly unhappy with the school and is always suspicious of the intentions of adults because he believes that they use their power over the younger students to hurt and abuse. He is involved in top-secret missions for the Academy which are shady and haven't quite been explained in the story yet, although he often returns injured. 
  
 He is paired up as Mikan's partner in class by the their mostly-absent class teacher, Narumi. Although at first he rebels strongly against this duty, he later accepts it and begins to enjoy Mikan's company, along with the company of his classmates and finds himself getting friendlier as the series progresses, although he never quite loses his dangerous edge and temper. 
  
 He possesses the fire Alice. It is revealed early on that since Natsume has such a powerful Alice, it causes a lot of stress on his body to use and shortens his lifespan immensely. He had been showing the symptoms of a life shortening Alice for a year before the start of the series and had been progressing quickly due to the constant use of his abilities for missions for the Academy. Because of this, he can be seen quite a few times through the manga coughing blood or even going unconcious.",11,,,140 cm,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/2394/Natsume_Hyuuga: 'src'

 Birthdate:  September 21 
 Occupation: High school student 
 Affiliation: Tousei Academy (Student); Chocolate Rabbit Guild (Member) 
  
 Akito Yamada is a high school student in his graduating year at the elite Tousei Academy. He is also a professional gamer. He is well-known in the gaming community for his expertise. He is attractive, but struggles to communicate with people (mainly women). He is initially antagonistic to Akane, whom he met during an offline event. 
  
 Yamada is a tall and lean. Most people perceive him as extraordinarily attractive, whether women or men, which causes him to respond most of the time awkwardly because he is an introvert. As a student at Tousei Academy, he wore the standard high school uniform throughout the first half of the series. Because his hair is longer, he would split it nicely to the left side. His hair reaches at least to his neck. His fringes are also nasal bridge length; if he doesn't separate them, they can cover his eyes. 
  
 He was dressed casually in a simple light-colored shirt, pants, and shoes during his first encounter with Akane at the Forest of Savior Game Event. Regardless of how modest his clothing is, Akane's initial impression of him is that he is attractive.

She is very innocent and dedicated. It is also noted that she is a beautiful singer. Despite her role as the titular character, she is a bit of an enigma within the series, as her origins have yet to be explained. She seeks to heal the heartaches of others, resulting in the filling up of a mysterious bottle called a ""flask"" with the suffering of those people's hearts so that someday she will be able to go to a certain place that she really wants to go. It has been implied that she came from another dimension. She seems to have no memories of her past. 
  
 Her only restriction appears to be that she cannot fall in love with anyone she heals the heart of. Curiously she also seems to not be allowed to take off her hat in public either, though this has yet to be addressed further. Kobato has a very cheerful and enthusiastic outlook in life and her wanting to aid others in need is very heartfelt and sincere. However, she can also be clumsy, rather clueless, and rash with her actions, and often trips over her own feet, much to Ioryogi's annoyance.

Link is usually depicted wearing a green tunic with a green floppy hat.  Throughout the many games released, there have been many Link's throughout the history of Hyrule that rose up to the challenge of saving the world from evil, mainly from the wrath of Ganondorf, the King of Thieves.  However, in the stories of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, it is the same Link who we see. In addition to the hero of time, the Link in Wind Waker is the same one as featured in Phantom hourglass. 
  
 Link is depicted as courageous, bold and although he is never seen to speak in the game, he shows no shyness in the manga as he is seen chatting quite a lot.  From his speech, we can see that Link is also a curious person who once he has a goal in mind, will set out and achieve it at all costs. 
  
 Our Hyrule savior, so far, has been the only one to wield the Master Sword, the evil-banishing sword. His swordsmanship is unparalleled throughout the land of Hyrule and he (usually) wields his weapons in his left hand.

 Temari is the oldest child of the Fourth Kazekage, making her the older sister of Gaara and Kankuro. Temari is generally overbearing, if not crude, toward those around her, often not being afraid to speak her mind. One of the few things shown to intimidate her is her younger brother Gaara. She very rarely stays true to her normally tough, demanding attitude, when around the boy, due to the fear of Gaara's wrath. Temari does have a caring side, and is not above showing concern for others. She is often seen with Shikamaru. Temari is a keen analyst, and can easily deduce an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins.  For actual combat she uses her giant iron fan that, in addition to serving as a makeshift club, can be used to glide upon in order to intimidate her foes.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/292452.jpg

 Elsie is a shinigami who was assigned to capture evil spirits that have escaped from hell and is the Deuteragonist of the story. She is shown to have a very sweet, pure and innocent personality and often tries to please Keima's expectations as a ""little sister"" though often fails due to the cultural differences between them and how her endeavors usually leave Keima in a bad situation. She is fairly popular among young males, apparently more people (primarily boys) began coming when she began working in the family's cafe, such that Keima's mother once had her dress as a maid to attract more customers on the ground that no-one could resist her when she's wearing it (from the reactions around her while she's wearing it and after she takes it off it can be inferred to be true). Her feather cloth (the floating scarf she is always seen with) can change the appearance of an object, create disguises to aid the mission or it can hide people in plain sight. She is left-handed and is rarely seen without her broom, which she had for 298 years, as it was from her original role as a cleaner for hell. She reveals that she has an older sister that was very famous and was known as the ""Demon of Demons"". Ironically, despite being a demon, she is shown to have an incredible fear of ghosts and the dark. 
  
 To stay close to Keima, she tells Mari, Keima's mother, that she is an illegitimate child of Keima's father (nearly getting his parents divorced), and ends up living in the Katsuragi household as well as attending the same class in school.",Over 300,,,159cm (with bun),,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/4/122016.jpg

Even though Bulma's character parodies a monk, her Japanese name ""Buruma"" is the brand of a popular gym short worn by girls in Japan. Her re-adapted name Bulma is a direct take on the word ""bloomers,"" which was a popular brand of women's underwear in the early 20th century. 
  
 Bulma is the second character to be introduced in the Dragon Ball series. In the early part of the story, she is the inventor of the Dragon Radar and is searching for the legendary Dragon Balls. Bulma was hoping to use the Dragon Balls to wish for the perfect boyfriend. While searching for a nearby Dragon Ball, she runs into Son Goku. It is at this time that she finds out Goku inherited one of the balls (the four-star ball) she is searching for from his Grandpa Gohan. Because of Goku's love for the ball and his belief that his Grandpa's spirit lives in the ball, Goku is not willing to give it up. Bulma then asks him to loan it for her in exchange of taking him in her travels. At that point, they team up to find the remainder of the balls and the adventure begins. In the later action-oriented episodes of the series, there is little room for a genius but Bulma continues to play a role as a secondary character, helping Goku and his friends with her gadgets, and having a rather rocky relationship with Yamcha.",,,,"5' 5""",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/280893.jpg

 A middle school boy who has chuunibyou tendencies. He loves spending time reading books in the library, where he and Anna first met. Initially, Kyotaro had delusions of killing Anna and making her corpse his alone, but they were replaced by romantic affection as he spends more time around her. He can be quite perceptive in social situations but often fails to pick up on other social problems due to his lack of communication skills and low self-esteem. Aside from his macabre interests, he's also a fan of manga and anime such as Baki, Beastars and Re:Zero. In the latter case he keeps the character Rem as the profile image for his Line account. Prior to middle school, he won a number of first-place awards for essays, a poster drawing, an independent research project, etc.

 Hanyuu is the mysterious ""transfer student"" in Matsuribayashi-hen. She has a pair of dark colored horns on her head, one of which is chipped slightly (however, no one seems to notice or mention them, with the exception of Takano, who calls her a ""monster""). 
  
 In fact, she has appeared to Rika all her life, but only in Matsuribayashi-hen and Miotsukushi-hen did she gain the power to interact with others, posing as a distant relative of Rika's and given the name ""Hanyuu Furude."" Like many of the characters, she can be frightening when angered, and with her spirit-like nature, her appearance can change with her mood until she takes a physical form. 
  
 She is very meek and often makes the noise ""Au au, au au…"" when she is nervous or uncomfortable, or sometimes while trying to make a point. She also tends to end her sentences with nano desu (なのです?, lit. ""it is so""). 
  
 She dislikes alcohol and kimchi, which Rika imbibes in large amounts as punishment when she finds Hanyuu annoying (as both Hanyuu's and Rika's senses are linked together). She mentions that she is a ""being above humans"" after being sacrificed to atone for the sin of humans, while both Rika and Takano describe her as a kind of deity. 
  
 Rika refers to her as ""Oyashiro"" when talking with others (evident from Shion's chat with Rika in Meakashi-hen) but does not personally think of her as Oyashiro; instead, she sees her as a close friend. 
  
 In Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei, Hanyuu tells Rika that she was sacrificed to atone for the sins of the people of the village, and Hanyuu asked Ōka Furude (Hanyuu's own daughter and Rika's ancestor) to kill her and then make the village a better place.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/451009.jpg

He unwillingly teamed up with Twenty-Fifth Bam and Khun Aguero Agnis early in the story, and he quickly became attached to them during the following tests. Due to his reptile-like features, he is sometimes referred to as ""Alligator"" or ""Gator"" and even ""Crocodile"". Rak refers to his friends and people he meets as ""turtles"" of different colours and features (ex: black turtle, blue turtle, crazy turtle); the term by which he also earnestly addresses his ""prey"". 
  
 Rak is able to change his size so that he is smaller and convenient to walk around because he is a Compression Lisensor which gives him the ability to shrink his size at will so he can move around the Tower more easily.

 Komui's younger sister, and assistant Head Officer. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young. Because she is an Accommodator, the Black Order took her away from her only remaining family member (Komui) to Headquarters against her will. For three years she was never allowed to leave the place, which felt like a prison to her. Because she attempted suicide, she had to be restrained and tied to her bed. However, once Komui joined the Black Order, Lenalee became more at ease in the Black Order. She once told Allen that her ""world"" consists of her friends and family; if something terrible ever happened to them, she would be devastated. 
  
 She is an Exorcist whose anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of boots, ""Dark Boots."" That, when invoked increases one's speed and strength greatly in the legs. 
  
 Aside from being able to have great speed, she can also fly with her boots. Techiniques shown so far:

1320,Sakura(サクラ),Tsubasa ChronicleTsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no HimegimiTsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season,1237,https://myanimelist.net/character/127/Sakura,"Birthday: April 1 
 Age: 14 
  
 At the start of the series in both manga and anime, Sakura is the princess of the Kingdom of Clow who has feelings for Syaoran, her childhood friend. 
  
 When she is about to confess her feelings, a mysterious force causes her own dormant magical powers to manifest in the form of feathered wings. When her feathers are scattered across time and space, Syaoran vows to recover all of them because each feather represents a memory Sakura has had since birth and are connected to her heart; without the feathers, she will die. 
  
 Fei-Wong Reed (the mysterious villain in the series) reflects on the ability of people like the High Priest Yukito, Princess Tomoyo of Nihon, and Yūko to cross dimensions and comments that the power concealed within Sakura and the ruins in Clow Country surpasses them all. 
  
 In order to cross dimensions, Sakura must pay Yūko the thing most important to her and she pays Yūko in an indirect way but her price is pretty much the same as Syaoran - her memories of him. When she awakes in the Hanshin Republic the first person she sees is Syaoran, but she does not remember anything about him, asking ""Who are you?"" 
  
 At times, such as in Ōuto, Sakura comes extremely close to remembering Syaoran but it is quickly erased once more from her memory. Syaoran, having known this would happen previously, will never tell her anything about their previous relationship. At most, all Sakura knows about Syaoran is what she has relearned from the adventures together with Mokona, Fai, and Kurogane, although she knows she knew him previously and he was very important to her. It is also clear that she is falling in love with him once more. 
  
 Sakura possesses unnaturally good luck; both Chun Hyang and Yūko call her ""a favored daughter of the gods"". This is what allowed her to travel dimensions safely until Yūko asks for her good luck as a price. According to Yukito and Syaoran, Sakura also has the ability to ""hear"" the voices of those who cannot be heard, such as spirits of nature, and to see ghosts. Such as the time in the Country of Jade, she can see Princess Emeraude while others couldn't. She can also see the future in visions, though this ability is unreliable and nothing she has control over. 
  
 Sakura's personality is passive and weary, exhausted from her loss of memories. However as the series goes on, she becomes more stronger and independent. Syaoran states, even though she's lost most of her memories, she'll never change. She helps the group whenever she can, whether it's washing dishes or saving their lives.",14,,,,,Error processing https://myanimelist.net/character/127/Sakura: 'src'

 Height: 173 cm 
 Weight: 60 kg 
 Family: father (deceased), mother (deceased) 
 Allies: Markkio, Al-Thamen, Gyokuen Ren (former), Hakuei Ren, Kouen Ren, Kouha Ren, Koumei Ren, Kougyoku Ren, Hakuryuu Ren 
 Enemies: Sinbad, Ja'far, Masrur, Aladdin, Alibaba Saluja, Ugo 
 Djinn: Cassim (former) 
 Occupation: Magi, Magician and Oracle 
 Affiliation: Kou Empire and Al-Thamen 
  
 Judar is one of the four Magi in the current era and a Magician specialized in Ice Magic. He is the Oracle of Al-Thamen and the Kou Empire. 
  
 Judar is very powerful, cruel, arrogant and somewhat childish. Usually he doesn't listen to anyone's advice or orders, and does things his own way. He is usually disrespectful, even to his fellow Magi. He seems to be careless about what others think, goading Sinbad into feeling pity for him and then laughing at him. He is a good actor, and goes to great lengths to mock others. 
  
 However, he also seems to hold deep grudges as he couldn't forgive Al-Thamen or Gyokuen Ren for using his life for their own ends and asked why they couldn't have used Scheherazade or Yunan and why it had to be him. 
  
 Judar was chosen by the Rukh and was born in a poor village in the far east plain. Right after Judar was born, his parents, along with everyone else in his village, were immediately killed by Al-Thamen. Judar was taken by the organization, and was taken advantage of before he was able to understand anything. He was taught magic there. He has been in this situation since infancy. Shortly after the founding of the Kou Empire, he was taken there by Al-Thamen and became the empire's Oracle and High Priest. 
  
 Judar was trained in Magic ever since infancy by the members of Al-Thamen. Since he specializes in Ice Magic he is a ""Blue Magician"", as ice is a sub-type of Water Magic. Being a Magi, he has an almost limitless supply of Magoi. Nevertheless, without Magic Judal it becomes completely useless, for its physical capacity is very low, having to depend on someone else. 
  
 He is named after the eponymous hero of The Tale of Judar and His Brethren from One Thousand and One Nights.

During the Meiji era, he lived as a police officer under the name of Gorou Fujita. In the Rurouni Kenshin series, he plays the role of Kenshin's old rival and enemy from the Bakumatsu. He has no compassion or mercy for his enemies and he lives by the Shinsengumi code ""Aku Soku Zan (悪即斬),"" literally ""Slay Evil Immediately,"" but more poetically rendered as ""Swift Death To Evil."" His signature technique is the Gatotsu, a left-handed thrust and a variation of the Hirazuki technique developed by Toshizou Hijikata, the Vice Commander of the Shinsengumi. Although the Gatotsu is a fictional technique only found within the Rurouni Kenshin series, the Hirazuki is a real technique that was used by many of the Shinsengumi members.

 In most situations, Sarada is kind-hearted and brave, polite to others and considerate of her friends and family, wishing well for them and standing up for them when they need her. She doesn't mind saying what she's thinking, whether it's a question she wants the answer to, an opinion she holds firmly, or a frustration she can't let go of. Like Sakura, Sarada is quite well-read: she feels comfortable arguing the differences between a panda and a normal bear, and she is apparently the only participant in the Chūnin Exams to have heard of the book series called Shinobi Strategist Detective Story, much less read all four volumes. 
  
 Sarada is appreciative of Naruto for his help in mending her relationship with her parents, finding him to be kind and warm. She is quite interested in his Will of Fire, wherein he tries to form bonds with everyone (particularly villagers of Konoha) that he can. Because of Naruto, Sarada decides to make it her dream to become Hokage, preferring the kind of life Naruto has to the life of her father. She is so fond of Naruto that in a conversation with Kawaki, she admits she has wondered on many occasions what her life would be like if she were Naruto's daughter, envying Boruto for the wonderful father he has and recriminating him for not appreciating and reproaching his father for his difficult work as a Hokage. In the anime, she even shows great appreciation for the Hokage Rock and fantasizes about having her own likeness carved into it. However, Sarada shares a complicated relationship with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, although she is also interested in him due to their similar relationships with their respective fathers. The two ninjas are often at odds with one another, with the young Uchiha valuing the Hokage post while Boruto initially showing utter disdain for it, and they usually argue and fight with each other for almost anything. Despite this, they are very close, deeply caring for one another's well-being and actually supporting their dreams greatly.","Gaiden: 11, Boruto Movie: 12",March 31,,"Blank Period: 125 cm, Boruto Movie: 147 cm",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/5/292448.jpg

After Asirpa saves Sugimoto's life and learns the story of hidden gold, the two start their search for the treasure. 
  
 She is an independent and capable young girl. She initially appears cold and withdrawn, but that quickly changes once she warms up to the other and exposes a more jovial and childish side. 
  
 When with her friends and family, Asirpa is a playful and cheerful girl. She enjoys cooking and is enthusiastic about hunting. She occasionally likes to tease others, especially Sugimoto and Shiraishi. 
  
 As a hunter, Asirpa is aware of the cruelty of nature. She knows that in the wilderness weakness leads to death and thus is very pragmatic about survival. She acts mature and serious when hunting her prey or discussing the plans of finding the gold. However, Asirpa has strict principles and beliefs, as she refuses to murder people even if her life is at stake. 
  
 She considers herself a modern Ainu woman who occasionally dismisses Ainu customs, such as tattooing her mouth or believing in fortune-telling. However, more than anything, Asirpa wants to protect the Ainu and preserve her people's independence. After her journey to Karafuto and the many revelations that followed, she has decided to find the gold to assure that the Ainu and their culture will never be erased or forgotten.

 The student council president and a second-year student. She is serious, diligent, and talented in most subjects. However, she is almost always thinking of perverted things, even suggesting that one of her main reasons to be interested in Tsuda is curiosity about information not covered in health classes. She is also a very popular girl with a lot of female fans in school, and has a complex about her chest, which is exacerbated by the fact that Aria happens to be more well-endowed than she is. She later develops some feelings for Tsuda.

1335,Ebisu(恵比寿),DorohedoroDorohedoro: Ma no Omake,1212,https://myanimelist.net/character/16063/Ebisu,"Ebisu is a young, androgynous and sullen looking woman who first appears in chapter three, donning a skull shaped mask. She is walking through the Hole, unable to summon a door back to the Magic Users' world due to the barrier between worlds currently in effect. She runs in to Caiman and Nikaido, who advance on her in their common fashion. Caiman cuts off Ebisu's fingers to prevent her from using magic, and bites down on her head after removing her mask. Before he can withdraw to ask her his ""question"", a frantic Fujita appears from a door behind her and forcefully pulls her out of his clamped down jaws, in to the door. This sudden and jerky movement causes trauma to her face and head, but they both get to safety. 
  
 After this incident, Ebisu is shown to be haunted by nightmares—and has become somewhat insane. At En's residence, she is restrained until Noi can properly heal and restore her fingers and face. Past that point, it is evident her head trauma caused some (supposedly temporary,) brain damage as seen in her suddenly eccentric behavior. She is commonly seen with Fujita in the manga panels, possibly leading to believe that they are ""partners"" now. 
  
 Her smoke is not seen directly, but records state she is skilled in Reptile transformation. However between panels it shows her having attacked someone with a surplus of power after being fed Black Powder by someone who appeared to have met her before. 
  
 She is often the butt of slapstick humor throughout the story, often being maimed in comedic fashion.

1339,Diavolo(ディアボロ),JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 5: Ougon no KazeJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 5: Ougon no Kaze Recaps,1207,https://myanimelist.net/character/27155/Diavolo,"Diavolo, the main villain of Part 5, was born in a female prison. His birth is a mystery because his mother claimed that he was conceived two years before her sentence and all the guards were female. Diavolo was raised by a priest in his mother's hometown of Sardinia because she can't raise him while in prison. When he turned 19, when the priest was constructing an apartment for Diavolo, he found his mother buried alive under a stone tablet. Around the same time, a fire broke out and the priest and Diavolo were among the seven who died in the fire. However, in reality Diavolo survived and joined Passione soon after. During that time, Diavolo recovered the bow and six Arrows in Egypt and quickly ran off with them. He then sold five of the Arrows to Enya Geil and kept the remaining one for himself (that same arrow was attached to Polpo's Black Sabbath). Between Stardust Crusaders and Golden Wind, he sets out to kill all his blood relatives, and those who discover his identity, to ensure his name is erased from existence and he took the pseudonym Soliddo Nazo during his years in Passione. 
  
 Diavolo means ""devil"" in Italian, fitting considering his personality and role as the main antagonist of Part 5. 
  
  Stand 
 King Crimson—A light red humanoid whose face appears to have a smaller copy of itself in its forehead, perhaps to mirror Diavolo's psyche. King Crimson has the power to predict up to ten seconds into the future, and ""erase time,"" effectively causing a time skip, where everything except itself and Diavolo is suddenly changed to be in the state they would have been a short time later (usually 3–10 seconds later). Time still flows normally for Diavolo, who can interact (or not interact, he can choose which objects to interact with) with the time-skipped objects for the amount of time that would have normally intervened (to Diavolo this appears in the form of the would-have-been intervening objects' states being superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to Nude Descending a Staircase). The nature of the time skip is such that, for example, he predicts a bullet coming at him, and erases the time that it would have hit him in. To the viewer a bullet that would have hit Diavolo will suddenly be shifted to be on his other side as where it would be seconds later.

 Ayato Kirishima is Touka Kirishima's younger brother, and goes by the alias Black Rabbit. He grew up with his sister in the 20th ward but at some point in time, he left the district. According to Kazuichi Banjou, Ayato subsequently began to wander all the wards of Tokyo, bringing sheer wreckage and chaos upon them, until his unique powers and abilities caught Tatara’s eye. Ayato was therefore pulled into joining Aogiri Tree, where he is currently an Executive. 
  
 Ayato is an arrogant, brash teenager, with a similar hot-blooded attitude resembling his sister's, while he normally displays either a scowl or menacing smirk on his face. Other than his physicalities, he shares many similarities with Touka, such as his tendency to use language that is often uncouth or inappropriate. He has a habit for kicking people over the simplest mistakes; such as when Kaneki failed to address him with the desired honorific, or when Banjou didn’t return his missed calls. However, he seems to be more harsh compared to his sister, but admits himself to be surprisingly ""softer"" than his Aogiri superiors. He is a firm believer in the notion that ‘the weak perish and the strong survive,’ which was triggered by the death of his mother and father. Ayato bears deep grudges against his father, Arata, for abandoning him and Touka when they were young. Ayato has even stated that the whole reason for hating Kaneki was his resemblance to Arata. It was also pointed out by Kaneki that Ayato cares deeply for Touka subconsciously, as shown when he beat her down first rather than allowing her to suffer a slow, torturous death from Yamori. Later on, he also took her alias, ""Rabbit"" so that the CCG would hunt him instead of Touka. Ayato also seems to have a soft spot for rabbits.

 Amuro was born on Earth and raised in the space colonies of Side 7. Amuro's father is an Earth Federation technician who helps the Federation build new weapon designs. Since he has seen many of his fathers work, he's a very skilled technician himself. As soon as Zeon attacked the colony he was living in, he came across the RX-78-2 Gundam and used it to stop them. 
  
 After countless battles Amuro learned of his Newtype abilities, and was considered one of the strongest mobile suit pilots. Since the Gundam was white he was considered as the White Ghost by many of his enemies. 
  
 After the One Year War, Amuro was placed under house arrest by the Titan forces, believing that he would join the AEUG. Eventually that is what Amuro did and was able to escape Titan hands with some help from his friend Fraw Bow. He teams up with Kamille and teaches him the ways of a Newtype, but he can't help but feel jealous that he's no longer considered the famous Gundam pilot. 
  
 After the war between the Titans and the AEUG, Amuro returns to the E.F.S.F. to fight against the Neo Zeon threat. He becomes part of the Londo Bell forces with Bright Noa. 
  
 Soon Amuro became one of the E.F.S.F. best pilots and was given higher honor among all soldiers of the E.F.S.F.

While in Korea he lives his life as a shut-in for an entire year being unable to find an actual job. After saving an old man from being killed by loan sharks, he was scouted and invited to join ""Q"" a local gang(gondal) to work under Tae-soo as one of his underlings. 
  
 After fighting against Tae-soo, he was offered the position of boss instead. He initially declined since he wanted to join the police force alongside Yumin but Tae-soo eventually manipulates him into taking the position. 
  
 His strength and sense of justice earns him the loyalty of his gang and the local community. As the leader of the Sun-Ken Rock Gang, he often hides his true identity from others (ex.: he tells Yumin he works at a video game company as a cover). Ken's parents were killed during a Yakuza war when he was 13. The character design of Ken is heavily influenced from Vash of Trigun Manga.

 In contrast to his appearance, he is rather quiet and gentle and has his difficulties realizing that he is Karasuno's ace as he initially doesn't feel that way. He shows to be weak-willed at the beginning when he leaves the team before the first years come, feeling that he let down his entire team when they lost against Date Tech High even though they counted on him.  After coming back to Karasuno, he realizes that his will to play volleyball is much stronger than he thought and with the help of his teammates, he acknowledges his position as Karasuno's ace (even though he is still mocked sometimes by Daichi for not having any ""ace-like presence"") and gains self-confidence. 
  
 Asahi is said to have a ""Heart of Glass"", taking everything that is said about him to heart and reacting depressed because of it at times. While he still feels insecure about a lot of things and seems to be quite a scaredy-cat, he clearly states that he has no intention of letting anyone take his ace position away from him in later chapters, showing his development from the beginning.

 Birthday: November 14th 
 Favourite Food: Jelly 
 Least Favorite Food: Spicy Food 
  
 Utena is a shy and introverted girl who longingly admires magical girls, collects their memorabilia, and talks about them passionately. At some point, her obsession had reached the point where she wished to fight alongside Tres Magia, but that led to her being tricked into joining Enormeeta by Venalita. 
  
 Although reluctant to accept it at first, her true nature is sadistic, and she tends to lack self-restraint when facing magical girls. When she first recognized she wanted to humiliate magical girls, she felt conflicted by her past feelings of admiration. However, after a near defeat at the hands of Magia Sulfur, she now more readily embraces her sadistic side. 
  
 She has a magical weapon that takes the form of a riding crop called Frusta Dominazione (Lash of Domination), with it she can strike inanimate objects, animals, and plants to create a Schiavo (Slave), a minion created by magic that can be directly controlled by her. 
  
 The word ""baiser"" in the name for her magical alter ego, ""Magia Baiser"", has French origins. When used as a noun, it translates to ""kiss"". When used as a verb, it is a vulgar slang term for sex.

1361,Hoozuki(鬼灯),Hoozuki no ReitetsuHoozuki no Reitetsu OVAHoozuki no Reitetsu 2nd Season,1188,https://myanimelist.net/character/79669/Hoozuki,"Hoozuki is the talented, sadistic deputy of the King of Hell, Enma. He tries to solve various problems in Hell. In his spare time, he takes care of the animals and raises Goldfish grass. 
  
 Hoozuki is a tall but slight oni (Japanese ogre) with black hair that parts in the middle and has a horn on his forehead. His ears are rather large and pointed, as are his fangs. Hoozuki's eyes are grey and slanted, with red markings at their sides. These red markings seem permanent as he retains them after washing and during his sleep. He wears a black yukata with red lining and obi with a Chinese lantern ( this represents both his name and symbol)embroidered on the back. He is rarely seen without his toothed metal club which is extraordinarily heavy, but Hoozuki's superhuman strength allows him to wield it easily. It is also noted by many women such as the Stone Princess and female minions think that he is rather good looking. Noted by Momotaro and King Enma to be similar in appearance to Hakutaku. He actually takes great care in his personal appearance. 
  
 He is very stoic and serious, rarely losing his cool under any circumstance (though he frequently blows his top whenever Hakutaku or Enma Daio are involved). It is also implied that he is very manipulative, shown in episode 13 where he admits to enjoying working for Enma as his right-hand man, only because this allows him to manipulate and control the Underworld from the shadows. He gets called a sadist often by various people, yet he himself denies it. ' 
  
 Hoozuki seems to enjoy resorting to violent means to resolving problems, seen when he confronts Momotaro and tells him ""This is Hell so let's settle this with violence"". Hoozuki sees violence as the fastest way to deal with whatever difficulties he faces and takes sadistic delight in doing so. He is also proficient in inflicting mental anguish verbally, traumatizing Beelzebub so much after their first meeting that the prime minister of European hell vomits blood the next time he encounters Hoozuki. Hoozuki's sharp intellect serves him beyond affairs of the state, enabling him to win any argument and cow potential enemies such as Satan and Momotaro's three animal companions. Those who fall prey to Hoozuki's sharp tongue typically sink into depression, vomit blood or develop a serious phobia of Hoozuki the next time they encounter him. 
  
 Hoozuki is portrayed as somewhat unforgiving in nature as well, grinding several of his goldfish plants into juice and feeding them to Enma as punishment for them trying to escape from his garden patch. 
  
 Hoozuki is highly skilled in a variety of arts inluding the brewing of herbal concoctions, rearing goldfish plants as well as combat. His management and organization skills are also impeccable, making him the most important man in Hell besides Enma. Hoozuki proves himself to be adept at killing two birds with one stone, using the mountain of left-over offerings of the dead to feed the ten kings of hell, or sending Momotaro to work in Heaven's peach orchard. The minions of Hell typically flock to him whenever they face problems and he proves more than capable of dealing with the variety of dilemmas presented to him with a combination of cunning and brute strength. 
  
 Despite his cool and sadistic exterior though, Hoozuki is extremely fond of animals. He expresses disgust, and even outright hatred for humans who abuse animals and treats Momotaro's three animal companions like his friends. In the first episode he is also seen discussing plans with Enma to visit the Outback so he can see Australia's great variety of interesting animals. Hoozuki also admits to visiting a great number of zoos all over the human world during his vacations there, hiding his ears and horns under a hat while telling curious tourists that he is training to be a ninja. 
  
 Hoozuki also treats women cordially, seen where he befriends Peach Maki and even helps her to punish the old lady who had been stealing from her ex-work place. When Hoozuki, Enma, Oko, Karauri and Nasubi are trapped in Cold Hell, Oko is also seen wearing Hoozuki's overcoat to help her endure Cold Hell's freezing climate. 
  
 Hoozuki seems to prefer women who are resistant to gross objects that typical women would normally shun, complimenting a female show caster on television for being able to study a gigantic grub without flinching. Furthermore, when Stone Princess asks Hoozuki whether he would marry her or her more beautiful sister, Blossom Princess, Hoozuki replies that he will marry the woman who agrees to drink his brain-tissue miso soup. Beauty seems to be of little consequence to Hoozuki compared to his ideal mate's ability to share his eccentric and often gruesome preferences. Despite his sadistic personality, Hoozuki is very popular with women who are attracted by his looks and reserved demeanour.The stripping hag constantly tries to flirt with him to no avail and many female oni in Shugou Hell are seen giggling while staring at him. 
  
 Hoozuki is a deep sleeper, but his wrath can be terrible once awakened prematurely. Once on vacation, Enma incessantly invited a sleeping Hoozuki to admire stag-beetles at the window and received a vicious kick that sent him flying as a result of bothering the oni in his sleep. When Shiro, Kakisuke and Rairo venture into Hoozuki's room to ask for a visit to Shangri-La, Shiro nearly dies of fright when Hoozuki suddenly awakens and grabs his tail. 
  
 A running gag in the anime series shows Hoozuki getting angry when he is told that he looks similar to Hakutaku.

 The snake of the zodiac, and big brother to Yuki, Ayame is vivacious, garrulous, and has a knack for making Yuki and Kyou angry. He runs a business that makes women's clothing, which men apparently wear as well, and he often wears women's clothing himself. He named his shop after himself and runs it with Mine, who is later revealed to be Ayame's girlfriend and the seamstress of the store. Ayame designs the dresses, erotic as some or all of them may be. Vain and somewhat self-conscious, he is really a thoughtful person underneath his ""selective"" skin. He has gorgeous gold eyes and silver hair in a startling contrast to Yuki's violet and grey. His fear, coincidentally, is a fear of being totally alone. Much to Yuki's chagrin and surprise, he was actually the student body president in high school. When Ayame was young, he did not care for Yuki at all until he realized that when he got older, he would be totally alone without Yuki, spurring his new obsession to gaining Yuki's love shown in the series. Yuki has slowly started to accept Ayame as a brother.

1364,"Prussia(プロイセン, ギルベルト・バイルシュミット, 俺様)","Hetalia Axis Powers Fan DiscHetalia Axis PowersHetalia Axis Powers Movie: Paint it, White",1182,https://myanimelist.net/character/18497/Prussia,"Nation's name: Kingdom of Prussia (Königreich Preußen) 
 Capital: Köningsberg 
 Language: German 
 Birthday: January 18 
 National flower: Cornflower 
  
 Human name: Gilbert Beilschmidt 
 Height: 177 cm (5'9"") 
 Age: 20 (appearance) 
  
 A now non-existent country that was dissolved by the Allies in 1947. He was born to fight, fight, fight, and avoided marriages at all costs. His hair is platinum blonde with deep violet-red eyes to match, but in early artwork, his hair was colored dark blonde and his eyes were blue. 
  
 In the past, he picked on Hungary, whom he thought to be male because of her burly personality and appearance as a child. Eventually, the two found out that Hungary was actually female, and since then, their relationship has been somewhat awkward, and because of their competitive childhood (and the fact that they still hold grudges against each other for all of the things that they did to torture each other in the past), they don't really get along. However, Hungary did mention once that she'd be very lonely if anything ever happened to Prussia. In response, Prussia often shows dismay and somberness whenever he spots Hungary and Austria spending time together. 
  
 Prussia's younger brother and drinking buddy is Germany, whom he affectionately calls ""West."" After he was dissolved, Prussia moved into Germany's house and has lived there ever since. You can usually find Germany cleaning and organizing their home, stumbling over and complaining about all of the ""weird"" décor and other things that Prussia buys. The two seem to butt heads every now and then, but overall, they get along pretty well and Prussia appears to be an affectionate (but terribly irresponsible) big bro. 
  
 It seems as though he also has a lot of love for Italy. He once took several snapshots of him (and one with Romano in it) when he went to Italy's house for dinner, proceeding to post them on his blog. Also, he affectionately calls Italy, ""Italy-chan."" 
  
 For several reasons, Prussia hates Russia. At one time, he was completely terrified by him, but currently, he's not as afraid. This was said to be because Germany is now a very strong and stable country that Russia won't be able to breach anytime soon, which, when reflecting upon this, was mentioned to make Prussia very proud of his little brother. 
  
 Although he was generally pretty close with his leaders, no other has ever come as close as Frederich II was with him, whom he calls ""Old Man Fritz."" Although he passed away a long time ago, Prussia hopes that Old Man Fritz is watching him from heaven and is proud of everything that he's done since his death. 
  
 As far as his personality goes, he's extremely loyal, and will do anything to become stronger. However, he's quite arrogant, thinking that he's better and more ""awesome"" than anyone else. Germany once said that Prussia has practically no common sense, but really, he has the diligence of a tough soldier; his bad manners kind of cover that up, though. Prussia's left-handed, and according to his profile on his blog, his blood type is most likely A. He's been shown to own a little yellow bird, which often sits on his head or shoulder. Prussia was not aware of this bird's existence until a ""fan"" of his blog ""sent him an email"" about it. The bird hasn't been officially named yet by Hidekaz Himaruya, but it's often called ""Gilbird"" among fans. 
  
 He refers to himself as ""Ore-sama"" ( ""Ore"" in Japanese is the male diminutive of ""I,"" but is considered more ""manly"" but improper when compared to its ""more-polite"" counterpart, ""boku,"" which also means ""I"" in the masculine tense. ""Sama"" is an honorific used when referring to someone of higher status than the speaker). Another (fanmade) nickname of his is ""Gilbo."" Although not canon, it is a popular moniker among fans. 
  
 His human surname was once rendered as ""Weillschmidt"" for some time among fans. However, since it does not exist as an actual German surname, ""Beilschmidt"" seems to be a more proper translation.

 Skilled, reliable, smart, and beautiful, Yakumo is one of the most admired girls in the school. Despite that fact, she has never had a boyfriend. This is due mostly to her mind-reading ability, as she can easily read the secret intentions of any boy who tries to approach her.

 Sagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekihō Army (Sekihō-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong. 
  
 The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself. 
  
 Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname ""Zanza"" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush. 
  
 Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc. 
  
 At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.

He is very attached to Oga, clinging with a vice-like grip to Oga's back. When he is agitated or sees blood, he will spontaneously electrocute anyone within his vicinity. Beelzebub's characteristic cry is ""Daabuu!"" and he is always naked with a pacifier in his mouth. 
  
 Baby Be'el is very easily impressed, especially by strong people since he himself is still weak and loses to other babies as well as to cats. On the other hand he is not the smartest one out there and tries to force his way through the most simple problems. It is also shown that he is afraid of insects. He often displays a fondness for things that might frighten ""normal"" babies, such as violence, exposed muscle tissue (on an anatomy model), heavy metal music, and demonic toys.

 A 17 year old sophomore high school student, Takashi is in the same class as Rei whom he has been friends with since childhood,He's loved her ever since she made a childhood promise to marry him when they were older. However it was his hesitance and ignorance about her feelings that caused tension in their friendship which led to her starting to date his friend Hisashi. He was one of the first people to notice that something was wrong in the school and quickly took action to escape with his friends. His relationship with Rei was shaken further when he was forced to kill her boyfriend after he was bitten and had turned into a zombie. Soon afterwards their relationship was amended. His resolve to protect Rei at all costs and everyone else in the group earned him their respect and admiration as a leader despite his own feelings of inadequacy. He often acts brash and will go out to risk his life to save or protect someone on a whim. Similar to Saeko, Takashi confessed that he's found an exhilaration in killing ""them"". 
  
 Though initially depicted as a poor student who often skips class, he's proven to be a very reliable person that all the characters can count on. Saya Takagi has once mentioned that he and Kohta are the most likely to snap if things keep going the way they are. Like the rest of the group, Takashi is determined to find his parents and to make sure that they're safe.

 The main heroine and number one ranked second year student until Kazuya's interference during a tournament at the start of the story causes her to be demoted to rank two. Having been abused by her half-brother throughout most of her childhood, she developed an intense haphephobia, a mental phobia that causes fear of being touched. She is feared by most students due to her ruthless actions against her opponents and anyone who touches her. After an incident at East Genetics, in which she attacked a Limiter who wanted to be her partner and other Pandoras, she was suspended for a year and nicknamed the ""Untouchable Queen"", transferring into West Genetics thereafter. Curiously, she does not go berserk when touched by Kazuya and after some time denying his company she accepts him as her Limiter. Despite her reputation and ruthlessness during battle, she has a quiet and reserved nature. 
  
 Her name is usually shortened to Satella or Stella. Formerly known as Satellizer Alongrutch, she was born from the head of the infamous el Bridget family who impregnated her mother Noelle Allouache. Her mother was very sickly and in order not to worsen their situation she was forced to endure the abuses of her half-brother, Louis, until her half-sister Violet found out and decided to move her away for her own safety. At her mother's deathbed, her mother apologized to her for the suffering she had endured and told her that she must never lose or give up and also to become stronger than anyone. Her memories become her driving force in life resulting in her severe determination and will. Despite her low synchronization rate with stigmas, she was implanted with six of Kazuha Aoi's stigmas before her enrollment into Genetics because of her family's influence.

 Fuutarou Uesugi is the main protagonist of the series. He is a serious and hardworking high school student, and a prodigy at the top of his grade. Due to financial reasons, he is tasked to tutor the Nakano Quintuplets. 
  
 According to Isanari, Fuutarou used to be similar to his father as a child, having a wild personality and being bad at studying. He currently lives a frugal lifestyle, preferring solitude. Someone comments that Fuutarou is always like this, trying not to associate himself with everything. Ichika comments that Fuutarou is direct and doesn't mince words. Yotsuba's first impression of Fuutarou is that he is a gloomy man and doesn't have many friends. His facial expression is always serious, sometimes he looks grumpy and annoyed, and he rarely blushes or gets flustered. Fuutarou thinks that being the Class Representative would only be hindering his studies. 
  
 Fuutarou is noted to have a big ego and high confidence. He can also be rude and direct, but he is actually able to contain his emotions. Despite that, Fuutarou could momentarily lose his composure when agitated and faced with unfavorable circumstances. He also does not like to get involved with other people's problems, as they find it troublesome. 
  
 Fuutarou has been shown to be very hardworking and has a lot of patience, as he is able to tutor several girls who have below average scores. It is personally stated and implied that Fuutarou currently has no interest in romantic relationships. He considers love as something silly. 
  
 Raiha describes Fuutarou as an ""overconfident"" guy and a ""study freak"". 
  
 Nino encourages Fuutarou about his future love life, despite labeling him a tactless guy. Ichika also said the same thing when she visited him in the hospital. 
  
 Fuutarou has a habit of covering his mouth with his left hand when he feels embarrassed

Conan & Heiji VS Kid!Meitantei Conan Movie 10: Tantei-tachi no Requiem,1159,https://myanimelist.net/character/1745/Heiji_Hattori,"Hattori Heiji is a high school detective from Osaka, titled Great Detective of the West. He came to Tokyo to test himself against Shinichi. Thanks to his detective skills, Heiji eventually figured out that Conan is the brains behind Mouri, and that Conan is in fact Shinichi. The two become good friends after that, working on cases together when the opportunity arises. Occasionally Heiji gets Conan into a tight spot by calling him Kudou in front of Ran, but thanks to his puns, everything always seems alright. 
  
 Heiji has a strong Kansai accent and he can't seem to speak standard Japanese because his accent is so strong. Heiji is the son of the Osaka district police commissioner (a position at the top of the hierarchy), but Heiji prefers to get by on his own merits. Heiji gets his slightly dark skin from his grandfather. His childhood friend, Toyama Kazuha, has a budding, but denied romance going with him. In Detective Conan's 7th movie, it's revealed that Kazuha is apparently Heiji's first love, but Kazuha didn't know about it.

 Famiglia: Vongola/Bovino

 Lambo is a hitman assassin from Italy's Bovino family. He is also the self proclaimed rival of Reborn. 
  
 His main choice of weapons are hand grenades and horns, and his future dream is to rule the world. Lambo dresses in a cow suit complete with a tail and has a huge afro with horns on the sides of his head which gives him the appearance of a bison. He has pretty good resistance against lightning. 
  
 Although he claims to be the ""great Lambo-san,"" Lambo is a total crybaby. Because of that he occasionally uses the Ten Year Bazooka to switch places with his 10-year older alternative. But, it is seen that even 10 years older Lambo is still a complete crybaby and unable to beat Reborn. Though if he uses the 10-year bazooka again, he becomes very powerful.

 Rank: Kame-sennin (Turtle Hermit) 
  
 The ""Turtle Immortal"" is an ancient and wise martial arts master and the first Earthling to wield the Kamehameha. Though he seems frail, he is a mighty warrior. Muten-Rôshi trained Grandpa Son Gohan, Ox King, Son Goku, Kuririn, and Yamcha. His home, Kame House, a shack on a small isolated island, serves as a gathering place for the Z Fighters and friends. He is a stock character, as he is both the archetypal wise old man and dirty old man, the latter being typical of shōnen anime. Sometimes he gets cranky, which further provides comic relief. He is bald, with a thick goatee and a thick mustache. Muten-Rôshi wears beach clothes or a martial arts suit and a turtle shell on his back. He usually wields a walking stick. His companions are usually Oolong, Umigame and Lunch.

 The dragon of the Zodiac and the private doctor to the Souma clan. Hatori is serious and is often without a sense of humor. It's his job to erase the memories of those who discover the Souma clan secret, though it is not entirely clear if this is simply a form of hypnosis or more of a supernatural power. When his curse activates he turns into a seahorse rather than an actual dragon, because the Chinese consider the seahorse to be baby dragons and the actual name in Japanese translates to it. He is very self-conscious about his transformation in the fact that he is the ""great and powerful dragon"" but appears as a ""seahorse."" He has had a bad experience in love with his ""Spring,"" a woman named Kana who was the assistant in his office. The relationship ended when Hatori asked Akito to give him permission to marry Kana. Akito threw a pot at Hatori and left him almost blind in the left eye. Kana felt so guilty about the incident and blamed herself completely. She was eventually driven insane with depression and guilt to the point where Hatori was forced to erase her memory in order to ease her suffering. Like Shigure and Ayame, he is very tall, and he is really a nice guy upon deeper inspection.

When Joseph asked him about a future meeting, Jesus made a map in the sand showing Joseph nine locations. 
  
 Jesus then traveled east across the continent, learning new languages and cultures until he reached the sea. Making a ship with the help of the locals, he set off across the sea to what would be known as America, where he lived, aged, and was finally put to rest. He seemed to have at least partial connection with the natives, who stated prior to his deathbed that they wished to see him. Shortly after his death, a large earthquake tore the ground apart, dividing his corpse by the movement of sand and relocating it to the different areas of America that would become the nine locations on Joseph of Arimathea's map.

However, to the reader it is clear that Black Jack actually is a good man: he is anti-wealth and anti-prestige, and believes he is actually doing rich people a favor by removing their material wealth. The opposition to wealth and power is a common theme in Tezuka's work: powerful men are almost always portrayed in a negative light.

 Birthday: June 18, 1984 
 Birthplace: Kanagawa-ken, Japan 
  
 Hiramaru was a salary man that hated working. On hearing Takagi and Mashiro talking about drawing manga on the subway and finding an abandoned copy of Jack, he quit his job to be a mangaka because he thought it would be less work for him. He is a different kind of genius compared to Eiji because he is talented even though he just started to write manga more in of a spur of the moment. 
  
 After teaching himself to draw manga in a very short amount of time, his manga, Otters 11 is serialized. He is hailed as a genius by Koji Yoshida who pushed for his serialization saying that Hiramaru had no real motivation to continue as a mangaka and failure would just make him quit. 
  
 Hiramaru is extremely lazy and immediately regrets getting serialized due to the amount of work to keep up a weekly series. He has said that he doesn't know why people have to work for a living and that he wants to sleep when he's tired and to eat when he's hungry. Due to his laziness, his editor, Koji Yoshida, often schemes to manipulate Hiramaru into working. Hiramura often tries to escape Yoshida to avoid working. His attempts to escape Yoshida is a long-running gag in the manga. 
  
 He is also a chronic hypochondriac and often makes incredible claims of illness. However, he is always proven healthy by the doctors. It's mostly believed that his ""illnesses"" are not only a product of his own fears, but also serves as an excuse to avoid work. 
  
 Hiramaru has a huge crush on Aoki Yuriko. Yoshida bribes him into doing work by giving him weekly facts about Aoki. Yoshida also often depicts dramatic scenarios of Aoki rejecting him due to his laziness or inability to produce names to energize him to work hard. Because he can't stand the idea of losing Aoki in his life, a combination of his own anxiety and Hiramaru's end-game scenarios, he works feverishly in hopes his work will earn Aoki's heart.","26 (debut), 34 (end)",,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/8/113540.jpg

 Occupation: Adventurer 
 Birthplace: Christmas Island 
 Alignment: Hero 
  
 Sonic the Hedgehog, nicknamed the ""Blue Blur,"" is well-known for his speed which is called ""second to none."" He made his first appearance in the game ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" for the Sega Genesis in 1991. Though he enjoys lazing around and simply enjoying himself, most of the games focus on the main antagonist Dr. Robotnik attempting to take over the world, only to be stopped by Sonic and occasionally several of his friends every time. 
  
 His best friend is Miles Prower, more commonly called Tails. Acting as somewhat of a sidekick and slowly maturing into more of a partner as the games go on, the young fox has a knack for inventing things and other machinery. 
  
 Lots of times he'll also team up with Knuckles the Echidna, guardian of the Master Emerald. He's been called his rival on several occasions and the two get along well (most of the time). 
  
 Sonic is prideful and hates to be constrained, enjoying freedom and doing things at his own pace (which is always incredibly fast). Though he is cocky and rather impatient, he is someone who would never turn their back on a friend in need or to protect the greater good (on several occasions performing actions that nearly result in his death). 
  
 Sonic mainly fights by curling into a ball and spinning at high speeds (known as the Spinball, Spin Dash, etc). He is also a master in Capoeira (a Brazilian martial art).

Despite being a duras, he is currently acting alongside the Gioh family. Though his true age is unknown, in human terms he appears to be a university student. Normally reserved and expressionless, Luka's facial expression softens around Yuki. It was during the Last Battle that Luka defected over to the humans. In the previous era, he and ""female"" Yuki were lovers. 
  
 Luka battles with a large black sword and can use powerful magic (and even summon a powerful Salamander dragon). He was once the loyal dog for the demon king and used to drink his blood, that's why he is stronger than any opasts and it's possible that he is stronger than the demon king himself. But he left his position as the loyal dog for the demon king after meeting Yuki. It was during the previous battle that Luka met Yuki and they fell in love. The current Yuki doesn't remember being Luka's lover, but every time he sees Luka his heart responds strongly. Luka refuses to tell Yuki about their past, but stands by the current male Yuki and promises he will stay with Yuki as long as Yuki wants him to. 
  
 The manga suggests a bit of a darker history. Luka tells Yuki he was considered a slave because he belonged to the ""sinner"" clan, Crosszeria, and that all the other duras were intent on punishing the whole family and all its descendants. The demon king owned Luka, and as a symbol of this, put his own blood into Luka's brand. The demon king's blood made the brand on Luka's arm glow red, and it caused Luka a great deal of pain during the process. Years later, Luka is still haunted by the memory and feels physically ill when recalling it. Because it was a blood seal, if Luka should ever betray the demon king, he would die. Luka explains to the current incarnation of Yuki that since he made a new contract with Yuki, the previous contract with the demon king was voided, allowing Luka to live. Luka hints that the prior contract with the demon king may not be ""completely"" voided, however. 
  
 His twin brother is Luze Crosszeria.

He is a very quiet individual, likely because the life of the ""Number Two"" does not allow him to have any close relationships with anyone, so when approached by others he says very little, if anything.

 He is a Featherweight boxer from the Naniwa Kentou Boxing Gym and a former JBC Featherweight Champion. He played the main antagonist during the events of championship road, serving as the second Japanese champion Ippo faced for the title. 
 Sendo's father was a fireman who died while saving the life of a child. Like Ippo, Sendo looked up to his father greatly, and this loss inspired him to try to be as strong as his father. 
  
 Sendo is an In-Fighter/Brawler with arm strength on par with Makunouchi Ippo or even more Raw Strengh than Ippo. To date, he is the only boxer to face Ippo more than once in the pro ring and is his chief rival. Sendo is a featherweight and his most well known move is his powerful smash. He greatly admires boxer Rocky Marciano, to the extent that he will personally point out that he is not the same ""Rocky"" from the film of the same name. He is also a fan of Takamura Mamoru. 
  
 He is first introduced watching a tape of Makunouchi Ippo's spectacular KO victory against Mashiba Ryou and, fired up by the tape, decides to go visit Tokyo for a match against Ippo. He leaves half-disappointed however when he learns of Ippo's broken fist, but declares hopefully to Ippo that he would be ""waiting for [him] in Osaka'"" when the time comes for their match, accidentally leaving a bag of souvenirs at the station upon his leave. 
  
 Since young, Sendo was known to be rude and problematic, having lead his own delinquent gang in the streets. However, it is mentioned by his grandma that Sendo did so to protect innocent civilians from other delinquent gangs. He and his grandmother run a market place. 
  
 Disheartened, Sendo does not put much effort into his training until a package arrives in the mail, along with a letter from Ippo stating that they may be able to have their match after all. Renewed by the prospective match Sendo quickly jumps back into intense training, waiting for the day of his match against Ippo.",,,,"167.5 cm (5'5"")","Professional Boxer, Marketplace Owner (with grandmother)",https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/10/70383.jpg

  Height : 161 cm 
  Weight : 53 kg 
  
 The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as Yuki (ユッキー, Yukkī), he is a 14 year old middle schooler who is a rather quiet boy with an anti-social behavior who doesn't talk much. He mostly sees things around him as a bystander and writes it down in his cell phone diary. Yuki becomes involved in the Diary Game when to his shock that Deus, a god-like being whom he thought was an imaginary friend turns out to be real, selects him as one of twelve contestants in a 90 day battle royale where they must kill each other using their special diaries where the last survivor becomes Deus' new heir. Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable. Furthermore, since the diary is written from his point of view, Yuki can be tricked into thinking something he sees is true without realizing it which is a disadvantage for other people who use the Random Diary. 
  
 Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki doesn't want any part of the game as he just wants to live peacefully and doesn't want to kill anyone, but is forced to play to survive and will only kill as a last resort as he is the main target by the other diary users because Deus sees Yuki as his favorite to win. Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user. Yuki is kind person yet is naive for quickly trusting people whether they be friend or other diary users as they may have ulterior motives. The most complex relationship he has is Yuno, while Yuno is a formidable ally, her mad obsessive love for him to the point she is willing to kill or use anyone so both of them can survive scares him yet despite the many things she does that shocks him. Despite this, Yuki still relies on Yuno in order to protect himself.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/13/134331.jpg

1422,"Otonashi, Saya(音無小夜)",Blood+,1119,https://myanimelist.net/character/836/Saya_Otonashi,"Saya is the main protagonist who hunts chiropterans using a katana. It is implied that she is the last remaining vampire and called ""the only remaining original."" Saya has no weakness to sunlight, although it is unknown if she has any of the other vulnerabilities often attributed to vampires. She does, however, become distressed when she encounters religious paraphernalia and angry when people mention God in her presence. Saya displays superhuman senses and strength, as well as cunning, resourcefulness, and skill. 
  
 The manga series suggests she was a human-vampire hybrid. Her age is unknown, but a picture of her with nine other people is shown in the film with the date 1892 and the word ""vampire"" attached to it. Though she holds most humans in contempt, she seems to have some sort of respect for David.

1423,Elizabeth(エリザベス / 江蓮),Gintama Movie 1: Shinyaku Benizakura-henGintamaGintama: Nanigoto mo Saisho ga Kanjin nanode Tashou Senobisuru Kurai ga Choudoyoi,1113,https://myanimelist.net/character/2946/Elizabeth,"Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura's companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian ""Elizabeth"" and dotes on it. Once in episode 18 Shinpachi purchased a doll named as Space Alien Stefan (宇宙怪獣ステファン) to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to ""communicate,"" as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen. 
  
 Although the true identity of Elizabeth is uncertain, it appears to be a man wearing a duck costume. In its first appearance, hairy legs are seen underneath her sheet and the body of a humanoid with glowing eyes is revealed as her mouth is opened just as it fell during another battle between Gintoki and Katsura. Although Katsura seems shocked at what she really is, she has subsequently remained by his side. Episode 50 implies that the person inside Elizabeth is most likely the director (Gintoki was interrupted before he can finish being cut off at ""Kanto-"" (""Direc-""). Most of the characters seem to ignore this, or at least do not give it much thought, given at the episode was completely filler. Moreover, the next time the inside of Elizabeth is shown, it reverts to the glowing eyes. 
  
 When Shinpachi boards Takasugi's ship in order to rescue Kagura, a bazooka is seen coming out of Elizabeth's mouth when she blasts the ship to distract everyone from Shinpachi. Because of this, Shinpachi refers to her as Elizabeth-senpai. 
  
 Elizabeth's birthday is September 7. ""Her"" height is 180 centimeters, and ""she"" weighs 123 kilograms.

She is a student with a strong sense of competitiveness which led to her popular nickname, much to her chagrin.

 When Hina was looking for Nitta, Hitomi was forced to help her. While waiting for Hina at Utako's Bar ""Little Song"", a regular customer at the bar started teaching her how to mix cocktails, revealing her talent (in doing actually everything).

 He is the main character, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. His affectionate name is Shin-chan. He loves Chocobis and an animated superhero named ""Action Kamen."" He is attracted to older girls and women, despite his young age. He brazenly pursues any girl who catches his eye. He shares this trait with his father and paternal grandfather, but this often results in Mom's cruel punishment. The only girl he seems to really like is a college student named Nanako. Some of his strange activities include dressing up and mooning. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at various activities including kendo. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness (for example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes), but these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. 
  
 There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others. For example, during the trip to Australia where he bumps into Kazama, he kindheartedly arranged for Kazama's father to play ball with his son after Shin-chan notices him being sad on the beach.

1433,Suiseiseki(翠星石),Rozen MaidenRozen Maiden: TräumendRozen Maiden (2013),1101,https://myanimelist.net/character/1105/Suiseiseki,"The third Rozen Maiden doll, and Souseiseki's older twin, they are both referred to as ""gardeners"" for their ability to communicate and tend not only to regular plants, but also to the ""soul trees"" of humans. Their artificial spirits also allow them to access the dream worlds where such trees are located. Suiseiseki must call upon her artificial spirit to summon her watering can which she uses to nourish the ""soul trees"" and to launch her plant attacks. She makes an impression with her high-pitched voice, heterochromatic eyes (her left eye is green and her right eye is red), and frequent use of the sentence-ending copula ""desu"". She is described by Shinku as ""the most timid and shy of the sisters"" in the first season and even as a crybaby in Ouvertüre. She is quite easily scared of strange noises, and prefers to hide behind her sisters in the presence of strangers. With those she is acquainted however, she shows a very devious personality. Suiseiseki adores the spotlight, and her favorite activities include smashing the window of Jun's room (hitting Jun in the process frequently), picking mercilessly on Hinaichigo, and cackling maniacally. She has a wild imagination, a short temper and a fondness for telling wild lies to terrify Hinaichigo, whom she calls either ""chibi-chibi"" (tiny tiny) or ""chibi-ichigo"" (tiny strawberry). For the most part, Suiseiseki and Jun seem incapable of being civil with each other; she refuses to call Jun by name, opting for ""runt"" (""chibi-ningen,"" which translates to ""little human"") instead. 
  
 Despite her attitude towards Jun, she does care a great deal for him, and her attempts to cover that up usually manifest in the form of more insults. In Rozen Maiden träumend, Suiseiseki stands out among the dolls in that she values her sisters' love more than the goal of becoming Alice. She is one of the few dolls who opposes the Alice Game, and has no intentions of becoming Alice if it means taking her fellow sisters' Rosa Mystica. Suiseiseki and Jun attempt, without much success, to convince the other Rozen Maidens that the Alice Game is a meaningless endeavor. In her brief appearance in the OVA, she makes the same appeal to her twin several times. 
  
 Suiseiseki tries to avoid participating in the Alice Game as much as possible, but she can use her watering can to make plants emerge from the ground and manipulate them. Her artificial spirit is named after the popular Anna Sui perfume. Suiseiseki was also the winner for Saimoe 2006. 
  
 Medium: None (First Season)/Jun (Second Season) 
 Artificial Spirit: Sui Dream (""Sui"" can mean Amethyst or Jade; called ""Sweet Dream"" in Tokyopop translation.) 
  
 Suiseiseki's name in English means, ""Jade Stone.""

Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his ""brother"" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the final judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear. 
  
 Having spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in Osaka, Cerberus speaks with a pointed Osakan-accent. He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical, and a glutton, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger. He becomes very fond of video games, and is addicted to sweets. Cerberus spends most of his time in a ""false form"", a small figure resembling an orange-stuffed animal with wings. Unlike Yue, Cerberus draws his life energy from the sun and is not dependent on the magical power of his master. However, his master must have control of the Firey and Light cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged cat. In the anime adaptation, the Firey card is changed to the Earthy card to avoid to delay his obtaining his true form. Cerberus' name is taken from the Greek mythological figure, Cerberus, a large three-headed beast who was assigned to guard the gates of Hades. 
  
 In the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by Aya Hisakawa, while his hidden form is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In the English release of the anime adaptation, his name is spelled Kerberos. In the English adaptation, Cardcaptors, it is changed to Keroberos. His false form is voiced by Matt Hill and Richard Newman voices his true form. In the second film, he is voiced by Wendee Lee and Dave Wittenberg, in his respective forms.

 At the age where all quirks manifest, it seems as though Chisaki's dangerous and destructive ""Overhaul"" manifested and brutalized his parents. Alone in the world, he was adopted by the elderly head of the Shie Hassaikai, and from then on Chisaki held a deep-seated hatred of the genetic mutations which ruined his life. The psychological scars this left him with cause Chisaki to break out into hives whenever he is touched; his personality manifests this as repulsion towards germs, which bleeds into his views on quirks. 
  
 Chisaki has many dreams: to revert humanity back to a quirkless state, to repay the boss for saving his life, and to become head of the criminal underworld. Using Eri, the granddaughter of the boss, and her ""Rewind,"" Chisaki believes her power and his might be the key to realizing these goals at last. 
  
 As Deku and co. tangled with Chisaki and his devastating power, the young head deteriorated the more he is impeded, touched, and backed into a corner, until by the end he'd become everything the Yakuza avoided to be: an inhuman, power-hungry force of nature.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/7/363701.jpg

 Zodiac sign: Libra 
 Height: 172 cm 
 Weight: 57 kg 
 Occupation: Lieutenant of the 10th Division 
  
 Rangiku is an attractive woman with long, wavy, strawberry-blonde hair (worn short in her youth), icy blue eyes, and a beauty spot to the right of her mouth. Her most distinctive features are her very large breasts, which are even larger than Orihime Inoue's. She also shares Orihime's strange taste in food. She dresses in the garb typical of shinigami, though her robes hang loose enough for her ample bosom to be revealed. She wears a necklace and a pink scarf over her shoulders. In addition, her lieutenant's armband is worn on her uniform's sash, as opposed to around the arm. 
  
 Rangiku tends to be a slacker who doesn't like paperwork and loves to drink saké. She's not the least bit modest about her appearance, frequently referring or complaining about her large breasts in casual conversation. She even tries to bribe Ichigo Kurosaki into letting her stay at his house using them, though unsuccessfully. Her easy-going and free-spirited personality is in sharp contrast with the serious Hitsugaya, but the two seem to be quite close, regardless. Rangiku is almost constantly by his side and has shown her loyalty to him on several occasions. While she seems somewhat self-centered, she is sensitive to the feelings of others, evident when she sees the concern Hitsugaya has for Momo Hinamori, the guilt Izuru Kira shares with her when Gin Ichimaru is revealed as a traitor, and when Orihime feels depressed about her role in Ichigo Kurosaki's life. Despite her lackadaisical image, she can be extremely serious when needed. She's shown to be somewhat maternal, especially with Orihime and Momo.",,,,172 cm,Lieutenant of the 10th Division,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/14/520193.jpg

 Known as the ""Galactic Fairy,"" she is a pop idol from Macross Galaxy fleet. She constantly tops music charts, and it is said that it is impossible not to hear her songs if you live in this galaxy. Naturally, her popularity is soaring high in Galaxy's sister fleet, Frontier. Due to her beauty and singing talent, she is a very proud and self-assured person. Sheryl has recognized the singing talent of Ranka Lee and often offers to help her 'behind the scenes' to realize her dream of singing.

She is logical and a very caring person who can't leave her troubled friends. Her biggest fear are cockroaches.

He is a bit of a joker but when the time comes, he's all business. His number is 42-42-564 (shini-shini-koroshi), which literally means die-die-kill in Japanese. He has a special move called a ""Direct Noggin Shinigami Chop"" (which is normally shown when the Shinigami shows his hand, which is a large, flat, four-fingered hand appearing from his robe). This is both a joke and a real move. He constantly has to put up with Death Scythe's antics when it comes to Maka or her progress. He seems to take on a more playful attitude when talking with his son, Death the Kid (he says he likes his son's three white stripes). Shinigami's soul wavelength is so large that it entirely covers Death city.

 A psychic girl with a goth-like appearance who has the ability to sense people's ""auras"" and send out electric waves (denpa). Much like Arisa, Saki is extremely protective of Tooru, who was the first person in school who had truly accepted her. She is very observant, polite and loves to eat (and is rarely seen not eating outside of school). Her nickname Hana-chan and her manga symbol, a violet with fangs, relate humorously in that hana means ""flower"" in Japanese. 
  
 Hanajima has a close relationship with her family who accepts and even nurtures her gifts. Her younger brother, Megumi, looks up to Saki and has his own special ability so that she won't be the only ""weird"" one in the family. Her mother seems to resemble Tooru's protective and caring nature (possibly explaining her attachment to Tooru). In the near ""parental"" protection she and Arisa give Tooru, she acts as the protective ""motherly"" figure. When Kazuma comes in for Kyou's parent/teacher conference, Hana notes that he is ""handsome."" Kyou is not too keen on the idea of Saki as his ""mother.""

1454,"Nougami, Neuro(脳噛 ネウロ)",Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro,1080,https://myanimelist.net/character/4479/Neuro_Nougami,"The title character of the series, Neuro is a demon detective from hell. He looks for mysteries in the labyrinthine minds of humans for sustenance. When he dismantles the mystery and strips the culprit of all of their defenses, that releases the negative energies that caused the culprit to commit the crime, which he then consumes. He came to the human world in search of the Ultimate Mystery, as all of the mysteries in hell were bland and repetitive. Once in the human world, he forced Yako to be his assistant, and began to solve mysteries. 
  
 He is a very self-centered, sadistic and arrogant character that cares little about the human aspect of the cases, most of the time only focusing about getting the mystery as quick possible. This can be a disadvantage, however, as he can't relate to or begin to understand the motives of the culprits. He will also commit blackmail and manipulation to achieve his goals. Neuro enjoys abusing and torturing Yako at every chance he gets, and thinks of her as nothing more than a slave to use at the beginning of their 'partnership'. However, recently, there have been a handful of times where he seems to care for her: saving her from injury more than once by explosions, comforting her crudely at the end of the Hal arc, and even stating during his battle with X that seeing her struggling to find her own potential was ""very pleasant"". A little before the HAL arc he was constantly telling her to 'evolve' and become more useful to him. From his actions then, it is possible that Neuro expects quite a bit from Yako, expressing disappointment, approval and even pride at certain times. 
  
 In public Neuro makes Yako act as the detective, while he acts as her assistant, even though Neuro is actually doing all the detective work. Even though Neuro is a demon, he still needs to sleep but not as long as humans; though the more he is more exhausted, the more he shall sleep. According to Neuro ""Shouki is like Oxygen to a demon"" and natural hot springs are formed when excess Shouki comes to the surface, so the best place for him to sleep is near a hot spring. 
  
 Neuro's true form appears to be some kind of horned bird, often revealed when he is about to feed on the released negative energy. In the manga, unlike the anime, Neuro isn't limited to eating mysteries made by crimes; he has, on at least three occasions, completely disassembled various things to find out how they worked, such as a car, a cellphone, and even a bomb. 
  
 As a demon, he shows his inhuman abilities in the early chapters of the series, making him seemingly invincible against human weapons such as catching a bullet with just his eyelashes but as the story progresses, Neuro has received injuries by several criminals. Neuro implies this to X that his body is gradually becoming more like a humans, because of the lack of the Demon's world's Shouki in the human world and that his body is adjusting to the Laws of Physics in the human world. His monstrous endurance remains and ensures his survival longer than what would have killed an ordinary human. Even while his body is weakening, Neuro still was able to easily defeat X in combat.

 Konan is the partner of the Akatsuki leader, Pain, and the only female ninja in Akatsuki. She was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars, forcing her to fend for herself until being found by Jiraiya. Jiraiya trained Konan to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, and as a result paper is a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless numbers of paper sheets, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area or form weapons for attack. She can even form wings that mirror her title as ""God's Angel"" amongst the villagers of Amegakure, as she often carries out Pain's, who has the title of ""God,"" will. Her abilities are constrained while wet, as paper clings to itself and loses its stiffness.

1461,"Hakubi, Ryouko(白眉 魎呼)",Shin Tenchi Muyou!Tenchi Muyou! RyououkiTenchi Muyou! Ryououki 2nd Season,1075,https://myanimelist.net/character/4322/Ryouko_Hakubi,"Ryoko is known as Ryoko Hakubi, a space pirate who was defeated by Yosho nearly 700 years before her release by Tenchi. Before that, she was a slave to Kagato. Her age is at least 5,000 - although she claims to be only 2,000. She was created by Washu, using one of her egg cells as a base, so she is indirectly Washu's daughter. Washu's DNA was combined with that of amorphous creatures called the Masu to create Ryoko. She has three red gems that are the source of her full energy, which also came from Washu. 
  
 True to the meaning of her nomenclature, the gem on the inside of Ryoko's left wrist allows her to summon powerful, ferocious 'demon' spirits, which let physical attacks pass right through them, while the gem on the inside of her right wrist allows her to control the summoned spirits, and the last gem, which goes on her throat, gives her full power. She also has the ability to create false gems, one that she keeps hidden in plain sight on her left ear as an earring. This false gem is not as powerful as the originals, but allow her to balance her power and abilities. False gems also last for only a limited time, while the originals have an inexhaustible supply of energy. In OAV 3, it was revealed that the true gems contain the powers and godhead of Washu-kami-sama (who is one of the three Chousin Goddesses). It is debatable just how much of her mother's power she is borrowing and how much she is capable of using on her own, but her relatively young age (she appears about twenty years old) prevents her from drawing upon their full power. 
  
 Other powers Ryoko possesses include flight, teleporting, intangibility, creating energy swords and energy blasts (All regularly used), instantly regenerating missing limbs (Episode 1), creating doppelgängers (Episode 7), telekinesis, creating forcefields, matter formation (manipulating matter and merging with it, as with a stone pillar in Episode 6), complex molecular restructuring (repairing Mihoshi's GXP scanner in Episode 4), hair needles she can fire from her head (Episode 11), and telepathy with Washu and Ryo-Ohki. In addition she can access an advanced internal database, as a group-mind shared with Ryo-Ohki (Episode 14) to constantly overview her exact universal coordinates (and presumably other advanced functions/information in addition). Some of these abilities are known to have been inherited from Washu, while others are likely the result of her Masu genes, or intended design. It is possible that she gained shapeshifting abilities from merging with Zero (Episode 12), in combination with her amorphous masu heritage. 
  
 As a character, Ryoko is very emotional. She easily gets upset, and is short tempered, especially around Ayeka. But she's deeply in love with Tenchi, though not fully admitting how deeply until Episodes 5 & 6, when she tells Ayeka how she first met Tenchi, and later when she offers up her own life in place of his. While she was trapped in the cave, she was able to create an astral body (sort of like a ghostly consciousness) and venture to the entrance of the cave. She watched Tenchi grow up over the years, and she wished more than anything to be with him. However, the way she introduced herself to him was terribly frightening to Tenchi, so he distanced himself from her for a long time. Also, when Washu is first introduced she tells Ryoko that she knows how she (Ryoko) feels about Tenchi and says that Ryoko wants to do ""this and that"" with Tenchi. 
  
 Ryoko also has a bit of an ambiguous relation with Washu, her mother. When Washu first appears, she critiques her daughter's sex appeal and asks Ryoko to refer to her as ""mommy."" As the series progresses, she starts to fear Washu, especially when Washu starts doing some of her experiments on an unwilling Ryoko. In fact, Ryoko becomes slightly cautious whenever Washu is looking at her with a mischievous smile and intimidating eyes. 
  
 Physically, Ryoko has no taste buds, and has no need to eat; all the energy she gets comes from the gem created by Washu on her wrist. Ryoko eats to be social, but has a taste for sake. Although she can get drunk like normal humans, Ryoko has the ability to nullify the effects of alcohol, which comes in handy if she has to go into battle. She can also instantly nullify any other toxic chemicals within her body. In addition, Ryoko does not need to breathe, and can survive unaided in the vacuum of space. 
  
 Ryoko, when kidnapped and electrocuted by Ayeka, seemed to enjoy it. Ayeka called her a masochist, and Ryoko quipped that she was more of a sadist. Judging by the fact that her ship Ryo-Ohki destroyed 28 planets and 69 colonies when in Kagato's service, and by some of her taunts in the fight with Tenchi, she might not have been joking. Ryoko is also sometimes rather childlike, and can be a bit gullible. Since most of her life was spent either working under Kagato, or sealed inside a cave, she does not have much of a range of experiences. She is also extremely sensitive about her age, being brought to tears when Ayeka called her a mummy. 
  
 In ""Ai Tenchi Muyo"" she is now seen constantly wearing an elaborately designed leotard with matching white leg boots, her hair style is much simpler compared to her old hair style in past ""Tenchi Muyo"" series.

 Mamoru Chiba is the major romantic interest of Usagi Tsukino. He is often portrayed as stoic, steady and introverted. This may be because when he was young his parents died in a car crash. This blocked his childhood memories of his current lifetime and opened up the memories of his previous life as Prince Endymion. Tuxedo Mask is a disguise Mamoru created for himself in order to hunt for the Silver Crystal incognito and, later, assist the Sailor Senshi in battle. 
  
 He is always addressed as Mamo-chan by Usagi throughout the series (Chibiusa also addresses him with this nickname later on). After dating for two years, Mamoru gives Usagi an engagement ring at an airport. The couple eventually gets married. In the future, they become king and queen of Earth and Crystal Tokyo and have a child together whom they name, Small Lady, but is in the majority of the series known as Chibiusa. 
  
 The manga develops Mamoru more extensively, showing that the car crash happened on his birthday and gives a glimpse of his parents. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), heal people, and monitor the status of the Earth. The anime tends not to develop Mamoru as much; however, he is shown to be more social than his manga counterpart. He's interested in a variety of subjects and is shown as smart. 
  
 Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.

 Knowledge: 95

 Huan Yi is a Vice General who serves in Great General Mou Gou's army. In the past, he was a bandit leader with the moniker Huan Yi the Beheader. 
  
 His personality is said to be extremely brutal as he has no qualms in killing surrendered soldiers and personally beheaded every person in any city or village he conquered. This is shown in how he sends Wei soldiers, who have been severely tortured, along with bags of eyeballs back to their camp to decrease morale and incite fear. 
  
 He always has an arrogant smirk on his face and talks in a crude manner at times. He shows no respect for his foes as he calls Gen Bou ""an old fart"" and ""trash"" before killing him. He is exhibits a sense of humor and sarcasm as in the case when a fellow crew member asked him why he made an unskilled man named Ogiko as 1000-man commander of The Huan Yi army, he replied ""Gyahaha cause it's funny obviously."" 
  
 He also has a cool demeanor and almost never displays any shock no matter how bad the situation is. Huan Yi also shows a very dark side as he toys with Haku Kisai by dangling the idea of escape from death if he begged for his life then stabbed him several times after he refused to grovel. 
  
 He does exhibits a sense of loyalty exclusive to Mou Gou by holding the rank of Vice General in his army and coming when summoned as demonstrated when Chou Tou used Mou Gou's name, as he knew that Huan Yi would simply ignore an request for a conversation with him.

  Things he likes: Everything about Celty, proverbs/idioms 
  Things he dislikes: Abstinence 
  Food he likes : Three-five-eight marinaded sandfish, Celty's cooking 
  Food he dislikes: Fat in meat 
  Favorite Proverb: ""Neither doctors nor the Kusatsu Hot Springs can cure the illness called love."" and every positive proverb about love. 
  
  
 A young underground doctor who lives with Celty and is also her lover. 
 He mostly remains indoors and wears his white doctor's coat even when he is not at work. 
  
 He went to the same primary school as Shizuo and Izaya and finds them interesting, enjoying their fights ... up to a point. 
  
 His father was also a doctor, and as a child Shinra participated in surgery alongside him, the most notable being an autopsy on Celty when they first met. 
 As a doctor he is rather interested in what he considers to be interesting phenomena, such as the unlimited strength Shizuo shows in times of anger, and Celty's healing, headlessness and bodily functions. 
  
 Shinra seems to have the ""capacity"" to tell what Celty is feeling, much to her surprise since she doesn't have a head to show her emotions.

 Tota is known as the most outspoken member in the investigation team. He plays a crucial role in the investigation of the Yotsuba Group after sneaking into the company's building without the knowledge of the team. His designated investigation team alias is Taro Matsui. 
  
 By following L's instructions, Matsuda gains the trust of the company's board members, fabricates his death (he uses the alias Taro Matsui) so that Yotsuba members can not kill him), and serves as a temporary decoy to lure the suspect into the Sakura television studio during the second Sakura TV incident. Despite his excitable, naïve personality, Matsuda manages to stay alive through quite a few dangerous times. Matsuda sees Soichiro as his mentor. 
  
 While it is clear that most of the investigation team views Kira as a an evil criminal, Matsuda often wonders if Kira is performing good deeds, especially since more and more people seem to be agreeing with what he does. Matsuda is scared by Mikami's intense loyalty to Kira when he hears Mikami's public announcement on Sakura TV.

 Before joining Shohoku, Mitsui Hisashi was an MVP for Takeishi Junior High. Despite having opportunities to join more prestigious high schools like Ryonan, he choose to go to Shohoku because of Coach Anzai; Anzai had given him the courage to win in the Junior High tournament by encouraging him during the last seconds of the match. However, an injury to his left knee in a training session interrupted his basketball career. An imprudent early return to the basketball court reinjured the knee more severely, leading to a basketball hiatus of over a year. 
  
 Although he eventually healed, he was embittered by his exclusion from the court, and Mitsui quit basketball and became the leader of a gang. His gang got in a fight with Miyagi, and during the fight, Miyagi beat Mitsui senseless before taking a beating himself. 
  
 Afterwards, Mitsui attempted to ruin the basketball team by instigating them into fighting with his gang, as the team would have been banned from competition for fighting. In the end, Sakuragi's own gang—Yohei, Takamiya, Ookusu and Noma—voluntarily took the blame for the fight, and Mitsui was filled with remorse when he saw Anzai again. He rejoined the team and vowed never to fight again. 
  
 Mitsui is best known on the team as a three-point specialist, though his skills extend to other areas; during a practice match, he once managed to shut down Sakuragi, playing center. His defensive ability completely shut down Fukuda's scoring abilities. His three-pointers helped Shohoku catch up when they were 12 points down against Shoyo, and again when the team was 20 points down against Sannoh in the National Championships. His greatest weakness, though, is his lack of stamina due to his long break from playing basketball. Thus, in the latter halves of games, he has not always been as reliable—he missed a potential game-winning shot against Kainan and collapsed on-court during the game against Ryonan.

1480,Tachikoma(タチコマ),Koukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex - Tachikoma na HibiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society - Uchikoma na HibiKoukaku Kidoutai: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG - Tachikoma na Hibi,1062,https://myanimelist.net/character/4808/Tachikoma,"A Tachikoma is an AI walker/roller tank in the Ghost in the Shell universe, appearing only in the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex sub-universe. They are best described as a ""spider type multi leg/multi ped combat vehicle equipped with artificial intelligence,"" possessing the ability to act as both personnel transport units and mobile weapons platforms. 
  
 Design: 
  
 Tachikoma are the size of a small car, and are of a middle-blue color, with four ""eyes"" fitted on the surface of their bodies. Three are on the ""head"" and one is beneath the abdomen. Each eye has three pinholes, possibly for triangulation. These eyes sometimes become expressive in the typical anime style. Tachikoma are controlled by individual AIs, are capable of speech and generally exhibit a childish, curious, joyful and active personality, although they are consummate professionals in the field. They normally operate as independent units and receive orders from human agents, but they can also be directly piloted from a cockpit in their abdomen. 
  
 Tachikoma have four legs and two arms. They can move by walking, or they can drive at high speed by using the wheeled footpads on each of their four legs. They are apparently street-legal (presuming no legal exemption for Section 9). Each wheel appears to be angled and omnidirectional, allowing the Tachikomas to move in any direction with their holonomic drive system. Other abilities of the Tachikoma include jumping great distances, sticking to vertical or inverted surfaces, engaging a thermoptic camouflage mechanism, and grappling/rappelling using their adhesive string launchers. Tachikoma maintain control of their legs while using wheels to drive down a road, and shift their weight around turns. They can also roll briefly on to two legs while driving to avoid an obstacle or pass through a narrow space. To make balance easier, they can move their heavy abdomens with a ball joint. Their movements when walking and jumping were modelled on a jumping spider. Almost all of the Tachikomas' physical abilities are showcased in Episode 2 of Stand Alone Complex, ""Runaway Evidence - Testation."" 
  
 Standard Tachikoma equipment includes a 7.62x51mm light machine gun mounted in the right arm, a secondary weapon hardpoint in the ""snout"" (usually a 50mm grenade launcher, capable of launching both explosive and gas grenades, but which can be replaced by a six-barrelled 12.7x99mm Gatling gun), a universal cybernetic connector on an extensible, prehensile cable in the left arm, and a built-in thermoptic camouflage system. 
  
 AI: 
  
 Tachikoma's are gifted with very childlike AI, unexpected of a machine in a governmental special forces team, which gives rise to much of the comedy relief in Stand Alone Complex. Though they possess individual artificial intelligence, every night they are synchronized, so they start the next day with identical consciousnesses that are each the sum of their total collective experience & development. This leads to identity confusion, since each Tachikoma has the same memories.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/15/98448.jpg

1483,Kon(コン),BleachBleach: Memories in the RainBleach: The Sealed Sword Frenzy,1060,https://myanimelist.net/character/1089/Kon,"Birthday: December 30 
  
 Kon primarily serves as a comedic foil in the series; when not inhabiting Ichigo's body, his normal plushie body is treated with little respect and much disdain. The humorously cruel treatment he is always subjected to provides the comic relief in Bleach. One of the only people who gives him any respect is Chad; however, Chad ignores him most of the time. His plushie body is a knock-off of the main character of the popular TV show Carnivore Kingdom, named ""Ponkichi,"" which happens to be Chad's favorite show. It was a prize from the shooting game in the Karakura Town Festival. He is constantly stepped on and torn, at which point Ichigo will have Uryū Ishida repair the plushie. Uryū usually adds something unwanted or unnecessary when doing so, such as dressing Kon up like a designer doll. Uryū also sewed a Quincy cross on the back of Kon's head as revenge after Kon attacked Uryū for turning him into a doll. 
  
 Kon is quite perverted and often takes advantage of his form to get girls to hug him to their chests, which rarely goes as planned. After Ichigo becomes less dependent on Kon to transform, Kon comments on how he wouldn't mind taking Ichigo's body out for a spin again, saying that he'd like go peeping and pulling up skirts because, as he puts it, ""It's [Ichigo's] reputation that gets sullied."" Kon is very fond of Rukia, calling her ""sister,"" though this extends to basically any pretty girl. 
  
 Kon is a special type of soul pill called a ""modified soul"" or ""ModSoul."" When inserted into a body, an aspect of the body is made superhuman, which in Kon's case is enhanced speed and strength. Because of the shady origins of the ModSoul, the soul society called for the destruction of all ModSoul pills, but luckily, Kon was shipped out with a load of regular soul pills by mistake. This gives rise to his belief that everyone should be given a chance at life and should not be killed merely based on the circumstances of their origins. 
  
 His name ""Kon"", which was given to him by Ichigo, comes from the word ""Konpaku"" within the term ""Kaizou Konpaku,"" the Japanese name for ""modified soul."" Kon wanted his name to be ""Kai"" from ""Kaizou"" because it sounded cooler, with which Ichigo agreed, but at the same time refused to name him that so as to not give him any satisfaction.

 Birthday: May 17, 1995 
  
 The main protagonist and the storyteller of the series. He is in his second year at Fumizuki Gakuen's High School and is an F-Class student. 
  
 Although he denies it, he is a rarely found 'fool' who even his own parents call him as ""the fool over all the world."" Not only are his grades the lowest, but he's really so stupid that he is titled the ""Kansatsu Shobunsha (under observation)"" from the school. For him his own safety is the most important thing and does not hesitate to use the most cowardly ways if needed, in circumstances where his harm is unnecessary. 
  
 However, he also has a righteous heart that can stand up against for other friends (except Yuuji). Even going as far as selflessly putting himself in harms way to help others, with no significant gain in sight for himself. Though shown he can have a perverted/active side, he's usually peaceful, gentle, kind and quiet towards those around him, which gains him certain popularity. 
  
 On the outside he is quite a bishounen, but is frequently thought (mostly by female students) to look better in a girl's outfit, and such photos and merchandise of him are secretly sold by Mutsurini—dubbed the hidden idol ""Aki-chan."" 
  
 He admires Mizuki but does not even dream of receiving love from her. While Minami has a heart for Yoshii, he thinks that he is hated by her after a series of events that almost killed him. 
  
 He entered Fumizuki Gakuen because his parents thought it was cheap. Yoshii's parents live overseas because of work, and for this reason he lives by himself. With nobody looking after him, he used up all his money for personal use and therefore was living in a poverty. His main food used to be salt and water—until his older sister returned back to Japan. Thanks to her supervision he couldn't spend money as he wished so his meals became normal once again. 
  
 However, because his sister and mother's housework abilities were zero, Yoshii is quite an expert when it comes to such areas. He is especially skilled in cooking. 
  
 He is right-handed, but he used to be a lefty (so says he). 
  
 Although his shoukanjuu's battle level is the lowest, he can comfortably stand up against high-class shoukanjuus thanks to his fluent ability to control it; however, because he is the Kansatsu Shobunsha, the fatigue and damage experienced by his shoukanjuu is returned to himself, he tries to avoid summoning during battles if not necessary. 
  
 Shoukanjuu's weapon is a modified Gakuran and a wooden sword. The Occult version is ""Dullahan (headless knight),"" influenced from the feature that ""No head=fool."" As told by Gakuen Principal, he is the one that is ""distorting the essence of the Test Summon System."" 
  
 As a side note, Yoshii placed 8th of the male characters and 13th overall in the 2009 edition of ""Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!""

 Height: 170 cm (5'7"") 
 Weight: 58 kg 
 Blood type: A 
 Species: human 
 Affiliations: Raizen High School, Ratatoskr 
 Favorite quote: ""If people refuse to accept you, I'll just accept you even more."" 
  
 The main protagonist of the story, Shidou is a student of Raizen High School. He was adopted into the Itsuka family when he was ""abandoned"" by his mother. He possesses a strange power that allows him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss; however, the seal will only work if the Spirit holds enough trust or affection toward him to allow it. Although considering trust and affection is a two-way street he probably needs to have a certain amount of affection too, or at least genuinely want to help the spirit from the bottom of his heart which he usually does even before seeking out a spirit. 
  
 Due to this power which was already known by Kotori Itsuka he was recruited—or rather forced—to join ""Ratatoskr"" to help and save Spirits. Instead of killing Spirits to prevent spacequake from happening, he has to seal the Spirit's powers with a kiss in order for them to co-exist with humans.",16,,,"170 cm (5'7"")",,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/202607.jpg
1490,Kurogane(黒鋼),Tsubasa ChronicleTsubasa Chronicle: Tori Kago no Kuni no HimegimiTsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season,1052,https://myanimelist.net/character/129/Kurogane,"Kurogane is serious and extremely perceptive, being able to quickly discern Syaoran's fighting ability (along with Syaoran's blind right eye) as well as Fai D. Flourite's true nature and fighting capabilities. While he seems rather irreverent, he is also very loyal. He is likely the most experienced fighter in the group and wiser than he appears. He becomes Syaoran's sword fighting teacher, presenting the boy with the same philosophy he believes in: a sword is used to cut only when needed and not used to cut anything if it is not necessary. While serious, Kurogane is very easily irked by others, especially by Mokona Modoki and Fai, who keep calling him ridiculously cutesy nicknames such as ""Kuro-puu"", ""Kuro-wan-wan"" or ""Kuro-rin"". However abrasive and ruthless Kurogane may seem, he has a compassionate nature and a desire to protect. An example of this would be how Kurogane continually questions Fai on his actions and character, and lets the wizard know that he should stop hanging onto his past and embrace the future with his new companions. Or, Kurogane's own statement that ""If someone wants to take away the ones I want to protect, I'll kill them too"". 
  
 His compassion and protective nature is especially clear when his actions early in the series are compared to his actions later on. He had straight out told Syaoran in their first world, the Hanshin Republic, that the quest has nothing at all to do with him. In the next world they visit (Koryo Country) however, Kurogane offers his services to help raid the castle of an evil lord, and stays behind in battle to let Syaoran go on ahead. Eventually, he risks a loss in strength to avenge his comrades' ""death"" (they were of course still alive) by defeating their killer in battle. It is noted that after he finds out Fai and Syaoran are still alive, he lost his passion for the battle. 
  
 He obtained a new sword in Outo called the Souhi (Blue Ice or Pale Ice) and taught Syaoran the skills of sword fighting and sensing attacks from the left.",,,,,,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/12/77672.jpg

 Birthday: November 1 
 Age: 15 (series), 16 (movie) 
 Ethnicity: Japanese descent 
 Place of origin: L1 Colony Cluster 
 Hair: Brown 
 Eyes: Prussian Blue 
 Bio/Notes: Pilot of the Wing Gundam and Wing Zero. Heero is known as ""The Perfect Soldier,"" having been trained since he was very young for the battlefield. 
  
 Heero Yuy is nothing more than his code name, however, named for the fallen Colony leader who's assassination the Gundam Pilots were supposed to avenge. 
  
 After his arrival on Earth, Heero encounters Relena Darlian, the daughter of an Earth/Colony peace advocate. After enrolling in her school, Heero ends up saving her life on several occasions, causing him to confuse his mission and his feelings. 
  
 Heero's first ally is Duo Maxwell, who helps him pull his Gundam up from the ocean. Afterwards, he sets out on his own for a while, attacking bases and OZ encampments. 
  
 His primary rival is Zechs Merquise, and they have several battles throughout the series, even trading Gundams from time to time. His other rival is Treize Kushrenada, who gives him the purely evil Gundam Epyon, which he trades to Zechs for the Wing Zero. 
  
 Although Trowa Barton holds the most mystery to his personality, Heero comes a close second, always disappearing after completing a mission or having an encounter. He lives by his emotions as stated by himself several times within the series and always thinks things through most of the time.  He was also referred to as ""the heart of space"" by Quatre Raberba Winner, Pilot 04, near the end of the last episode.

Born alone, lives alone, and fights alone. A profligate son, indulgent in sweets and ruled only by his own whims.

He is a prominent Z Fighter, despite usually being overpowered by the major enemies.
