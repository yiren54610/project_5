# MyAnimeList Character Voting Analysis

This project analyzes audience preferences for anime and manga characters based on voting data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/character.php). The goal is to uncover patterns in popularity and infer demographic details, such as gender, from available information.

## 📊 Methodology

This is a scraping-intensive project that focuses on characters who received more than **1,000 votes**.

### Data Collection

- **Beautiful Soup** was used to extract:
  - Character name
  - Profile link
  - Number of votes
  - Associated anime or manga

- **Playwright** was used to navigate to each character's individual page and capture:
  - Biographical description
  - Image source link

- The scraped data was saved into a structured `.csv` file for further analysis.

## 🧠 Description & Gender Analysis

Because gender is not directly listed on character pages, a custom script was used to infer gender from textual descriptions.

### Extraction Process

- Used **regular expressions** to extract:
  - Age
  - Birthday
  - Nationality
  - Height
  - Occupation
  - Biography paragraph

### Gender Inference

A scoring system was developed based on the presence of gendered keywords:

- **Female indicators**: `['she', 'her', 'woman', 'girl', 'female', 'lady']`  
- **Male indicators**: `['he', 'him', 'man', 'boy', 'male', 'gentleman']`

- Each detected keyword adds one point to the corresponding gender score.
- Gender is inferred based on the higher total score.
- The result is stored in a new column titled `gender` in the CSV.
